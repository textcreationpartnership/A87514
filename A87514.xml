            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt place mind what the word <hi>Goſpel</hi> is, or doth hold forth unto us: and you ſhall find that it ſignifieth good, or glad-tydings, as appeareth <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.7. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170393:10"/>
               <p>Now what is contained in this good-tydings is this, (according to the Scriptures) that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and was buried, and roſe again the Third day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4. and that in Chriſt Jeſus there is Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. and everlaſting Life, 46. this is the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>Goſpel</hi> is to be preached to every Creature by the Commandement of the Lord, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. that is to ſay, to every Man and Woman that have ears to hear ſo as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; not to Infants, for the Lord ſpeaks not unto (though of) them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.2. for they know neither good or evill, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.39. which is agreeable to the teſtimony of the Angel of the Almighty, which brought good-tydings of great joy unto all people, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this Goſpel was preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, yea unto them that received it not, (and that in all Ages) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2, 3, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.5. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.23. for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it was neceſſary that the Word of God ſhould be Preached unto them that rejected it; yet there was no leſs in that word than everlaſting life, which they put from them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. in much envy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170393:10"/>and blaſpheming, and raiſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt the Apoſtles, ſo that at length, they ſhook off the duſt of their feet againſt them, <hi>ver.</hi> 51. And you know that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be more toller able for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement, then for ſuch a people;</hi> So then the Goſpel was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, that never received it, as well as to them that did receive it; therefore unto all.</p>
               <p>Again the Parables, and compariſons in the Scriptures, proves that this good Tydings of eternall life, as 'tis in Jeſus, is to be preached unto all, as it appeareth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the ſower; for there you may ſee it is declared unto all ſorts of men, as the ſeed is ſown in all ſorts of ground; likewiſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arable bids all, even them alſo that would not, nor did not come, the bad as well as the good, for to come to the marraige. Alſo the compariſon of the brazen Serpent ſheweth, as that was lifted up for all, that all that were ſtung might <hi>look</hi> on it, <hi>andlive, Num.</hi> 21.8, 9. So is the Son of man, the Lord Jeſus lifted up for all, that <hi>whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Again this is the condemnation of the world, namely, the not receiving the light that is in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170393:11"/>Jeſus, held forth in the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 12.46. <hi>John</hi> 3.19. And how ſhall they receive it, ſo as to beleive it without a preacher? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. Therefore it is to be preached unto all.</p>
               <p>Again Chriſt will judge all men according to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. and he that heareth, and beleiveth, according to the Goſpel, ſhall be ſaved, and he that will not believe ſhall be damned, as <hi>John</hi> witneſſeth, that they that refuſe to hear the word, ſo as to receive it, ſhall be condemned at the laſt day, by that word which they heard, and rejected, <hi>John</hi> 12.47.48. wherefore Chriſt judging all men at the laſt day by the word of the Goſpel, and that according to righteouſneſs, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth plainly, that the Goſpel muſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all men.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſeeing the Goſpel is to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all, or this good tydings of peace, which is (as hath been ſhewed) that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth everlaſting life unto all in and through the death of his Son, it will follow that Chriſt died for all men, ſo as to ſeek to ſerve all men, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.11. yea, to ſet all men and women in the way ſo as by his death they might have eternal life. I ſay, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low clearly, that Chriſt dyed for all men, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170393:11"/>elſe the Goſpel will be the tender of a lie, which is blaſphemy to affirme. It will (I ſay) be the tender of a lie, becauſe in the Goſpel there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all (as hath been ſhewed) remiſſion of ſins, and everlaſting life, through a crucified Chriſt; but if Chriſt died but for ſome men, and this glad-tyding of peace in the Goſpel be held forth for all men, as it is, then to ſome of theſe (all) it will be the tender of a lie; but that cannot be, therefore I conclude that Chriſt died for all men.</p>
               <p>This further will appear, if you obſerve well, how that all men every where are commanded to repent, and beleive the Goſpel, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. and that is witneſſed in the Goſpel to all men, both beleevers, and Unbeleevers, that there is eternal life in Chriſt, and that they who receive it not, make God a lier, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Again conſider, that God doth bid all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and doth not mock any (untill firſt they reject him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25, 27.) nor doth he deal as hypocrites, to bid men to his ſupper, having before decreed in himſelf, that they ſhall never taſte thereof, but (I ſay) unfaignedly, and altogether truly doth the Lord bid and invite all perſons to come to the marriage ſupper, and (ſaith he) for, <hi>All Things are ready:</hi> now if Chriſt died not for all, how could he invite all,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170393:12"/>even them that never came, ſaying, all things are ready, when as to them that came not, which are the greateſt part of men, to them (I ſay) the <hi>only thing,</hi> was not ready; that is to ſay, a Chriſt crucified for their ſins; and ſo whereas Chriſt ſaith, that all things are ready; this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which I contend againſt, declares, that there is <hi>nothing</hi> ready, for I am ſure that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a crucified Chriſt there is no ſalvation for the ſons of men; and moveover to conceive that Chriſt died but for ſome men, notwithſtanding his ſo often calls, and loving invitations to all men whatſoever, to come unto him that they might be ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. whether in the city, or in the lanes, or about the hedges; to conceive this I ſay, is to liken the Lord Jeſus unto the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of men, who (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.21) have in their mouths words ſmoother then but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but war in the heart, words ſofter then oyle, yet were as drawn ſwords.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Scriptures holds forth plainly, that unbelief in the ſon of God is a great ſin, yea, the <hi>cauſe</hi> of eternal condemnation, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. Now if the ſon of God died not for the unbeliever, who is (ſaith Chriſt) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already; <hi>becauſe</hi> he believeth not on him, then the unbeliever is condemned for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a <hi>lie;</hi> but this cannot poſſibly be the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the righteous God, who condemns men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170393:12"/>for not receiving, and beleeving the truth, that they <hi>might</hi> be ſaved, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. Therefore again I conclude, that Chriſt died for all men.</p>
               <p>Moreover we find <hi>Paul</hi> (that eminent light of the world) in great heavineſs, and continual ſorrow of heart, yea and wiſhing himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from Chriſt for his brethren the Jewes, that were ſhut up in unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2.3.32 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9, 10. To whom alſo he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth did belong the adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes; now 'tis moſt plain that the Apoſtle doth (by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging theſe ſo many, and excellent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges pertaining to the Jewes) declare, and clearly preach up, that there was a time when they might have been happy, had they (with others) ſought after the righteouſneſs of God by faith; but alas, alas, they obtained it not, wherefore? (becauſe Chriſt died not for them, ſaith many) but ſaith the holy Apoſtle, <hi>
                     <hi>becauſe</hi> they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law,</hi> ver. 31.32. And this is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them as their great folly, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had been none at all, had they not (as well as others) been put into a capacity through the grace of a crurified Chriſt to have beleeved,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170393:13"/>and ſo eternally ſaved, which thing moſt aſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood touching them, and therfore he abode in great heavineſs for them, yea, and wiſhed himſelf accurſed from Chriſt for them, knowing and beleeving, that God had ſent his ſon Jeſus to bleſs them, yea ſo far (mark I pray) as to turn <hi>every one</hi> of them from their iniquites, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. and indeed to conceive the Apoſtle to be of a contrary belief, that is to ſay, that Chriſt died not for his Brethren, that were ſhut up in unblief; (ſuch a conception (I ſay) doth render the wiſe, and eminent Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to be ſimple, and fooliſh, both by his great heavineſs and continual ſorrow of heart; for that which could not poſſibly be obtained, to wit, the ſalvation of his Brethren the Jewes; and alſo by his wiſhing himſelf accurſed from Chriſt for them that could not <hi>poſſibly</hi> ever be bleſt; but God forbid that any ſober minded man ſhould hold any opinion that ſhould thus render the wiſdome of the wiſe of no effect; but however if men will thus fooliſhly preſume, wiſdome is juſtified of her children, who clearly underſtands that Chriſt died for all men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when they come to underſtand that men <hi>will not</hi> come unto him that hath died for them; that they might have life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. they underſtandingly (with holy <hi>Paul</hi>) greive, and are of a mournful heart for them, like the Lord himſelf; <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, 42.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170393:13"/>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle of the Lord, full of the Spirit declareth, That the <hi>Lord bought</hi> ſuch as bring in <hi>damnable Hereſies,</hi> and ſo <hi>bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> even <hi>damnation that ſlumbereth not,</hi> 2, <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. So then by this alſo it clearly appears, that Chriſt died for, or bought all men, ſince no man queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his dying for ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is before you a cloud of witneſſes eminently advancing the truth of this Particular, ſpeaking after this manner; <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſtoneſt them which were ſent unto thee! How often <hi>would</hi> I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and <hi>ye would not?</hi> Mat.</hi> 23.37, <hi>And when he beheld their City,</hi> ſo great was his love towards them, <hi>that he <hi>wept</hi> over it; Saying, if thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes: Luke</hi> 19.41, 42. <hi>Oh that my people had hearkned unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my wayes, ſo ſhould their time have endured for ever! Pſal.</hi> 81.13.15. <hi>Oh that their were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandements alwayes, that it might be well with them, and their Children for ever? Deut.</hi> 5129. <hi>Oh Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, wilt thou not be made clean, when ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170393:14"/>it once be? Jeremy.</hi> 13.27. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? How ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? As I live, ſaith, the Lord God, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live; turn ye, <hi>turn ye,</hi> for why will ye die, oh Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>And now O inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and men of Judah, Judge I pray you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me, and my Vinyard, what <hi>could have been done more,</hi> to my Vinyard, that I have not done in it? Jſa.</hi> 5.3.4. <hi>But when he looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes, it brought forth wild Grapes;</hi> As alſo Iſrael in the wilderneſs, <hi>Wherefore he was <hi>greived</hi> with that generation,</hi> and at length, <hi>ſware in his <hi>wrath</hi> that they</hi> ſhould not enter into his reſt, <hi>
                     <hi>becauſe</hi> of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, Heb.</hi> 3.10, 11, 19. Now that the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit in the Prophets, ſhould utter ſuch deep deſires, and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions for the welfare of a People, with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great lamentations upon their neglect of that which ſhould have been for their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22.) Alſo confirming his deſires by the immutable Oath of himſelf, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding know them (even from the firſt) altogether uncapable of happineſs and well-being, and that for want of that grace which himſelf is the <hi>only</hi> giver of; That God (I ſay) whoſe Attributes of love, and mercy are met
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170393:14"/>together with truth, and righteouſneſs, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth each other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10. ſhould thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf, is altogether incredible; for if he ſent not his Son to die for them, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Name</hi> given <hi>under heaven, whereby they might be ſaved, Act.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p>The ſence of theſe things being much upon my heart, leads me forth yet further to queſtion with you, <hi>viz.</hi> How the wiſe God, the Father, could <hi>grieve forty years long for a Peoples unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> if there was no Salvation for them to believe in? And how Chriſt the Son of God could <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> at the Peoples Unbelief, if he <hi>taſted not death for them,</hi> whereby they might believe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.6.</p>
               <p>And how the holy Spirit, the gift of God, could <hi>ſtrive</hi> with men for their <hi>good,</hi> if Chriſt, in whom is all good, was not intended for them? The Father, the Son, and the Spirit (according to the Scriptures of truth) in all ages plainly declareth, <hi>That he would have all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. in order to which he exerciſed much <hi>long-patience,</hi> ſending his ſervants, calling upon them, and <hi>beſeeching them to be reconciled unto himſelf,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And ſo God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all things ready for them, and uſing a ſufficiency of means, whereby they <hi>might</hi> come and receive it (according to the Parable) that is to ſay, <hi>might</hi> believe, and eternally be ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170393:15"/>1.7. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.17.2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. they not coming, they not beleeving, the God of love in wiſdome grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for them, and upon good grounds <hi>ſweareth in wrath, they ſhall not enter into his reſt.</hi> Mark well; A mans not doing impoſſibilities, or not beleeving on that which is not, is no ſober mans wonder, cauſe of grief, or ground of wrath; Wherefore all theſe things being conſidered, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the many more Scriptures that ſpeak to this purpoſe, as alſo <hi>many</hi> Scriptures bearing plain Teſtimony, <hi>that Chriſt died for all,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Rom</hi> 3.22. And not ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Scripture that ſaith, he died <hi>but</hi> for ſome, therefore with wiſe and holy <hi>Peter,</hi> I conclude, that the Lord God is not willing that <hi>(any) <hi>ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi>
                  </hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. and be ſaved through Chriſt the Saviour, <hi>who gave himſelf a ranſome for all,</hi> to <hi>be teſtified in due time;</hi> Therefore let all men fear how they teſtifie againſt it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If Chriſt died for all, how is it then that all are not ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Bear with me I pray you, if I ſpeak ſomewhat large to this Queſtion, for I know that there is ſomething in the underſtanding of thoſe that ask this queſtion, as the ground thereof, which is a great hindrance to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this glorious truth of Gods love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170393:15"/>all men; namely, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin brought him, and all his poſterity into a ſtate of eternal condemnation in Hell: which whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth, cannot eaſily underſtand how Chriſt ſhould die for all men, (ſay they) if he died for all, to free them from eternal puniſhment in hell, and Chriſt dye not in vain, then (ſay they) How can it be but that all muſt be ſaved?</p>
               <p>Firſt conſider your miſtake touching <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; for 'tis plain, that his ſin brought but the firſt death and the companions thereof, as fear, ſhame, ſickneſs, eating bread in the ſweat of the face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with the ground cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for his ſake, and not eternal torments in Hell, which ſaith the Scripture, is the ſecond death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. Firſt becauſe the ſecond death, or eternal torment in Hell was neither threatned to come upon him before his fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. neither is it in the leaſt ſignifyed in the ſentence againſt him after his fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17.18.19. but rather this, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return:</hi> this death therefore being only ſpoken of, which is the firſt death, let no man preſume above what is written.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve the ſence of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> touching this Particular, who ſaith, <hi>That by one man</hi> (to wit <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>ſin entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170393:16"/>the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death <hi>paſſed upon all men,</hi> for that all have ſinned, Rom.</hi> 5.12. Now in that he ſaith, that the death which came by <hi>Adam</hi> paſſed upon all, it followes with much plainneſs, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it to be only the firſt death that entred into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, becauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, or eternal torment in Hell, had not paſſed upon all, and ſo he could not mean the ſecond death; for he right well knew, yea and all men do know, it had not paſſed upon <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that might be mentioned; no nor never ſhall. In vain will it be for any to go about to evade the force of this text, by conceiving that it is the deſert of eternal death which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon all, foraſmuch as the Apoſtle in much plainneſs ſaith, <hi>That <hi>death</hi> paſſed upon all men,</hi> not only deſerved death, but death it ſelf paſſed alſo upon them, as their deſert.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, remember, and well conſider that it is granted on all hands, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin from the beginning, did and now doth bring men down to the duſt, or firſt death; and alſo well conſider, that it is as generally beleived, that the ſecond death, or Hell torments, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fence of miſery both upon the ſoul, and body; or an eternal, horrible, dying, and never being dead: both which being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170393:16"/>you may eaſily ſee, that if God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Hell torment to be the portion of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, either you muſt imagine, that God did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and decree, and ſo accordingly declare to <hi>Adam,</hi> that if he ſinned he ſhould for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the duſt, and afterwards be raiſed up again from the duſt, and ſo caſt into Hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is the ſecond death; which ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is very ſtrange; and beſides it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a Reſurrection without Chriſt; or elſe you muſt imagine, that God intended in his ſaying to <hi>Adam, — Thou ſhalt die:</hi> that his ſoul ſhould go into hell torment, the ſecond death; and his body to the duſt, the firſt death: which <hi>Dagon</hi>-like Image ſhamefully falls before the Ark of truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it renders the coming of Chriſt, the greateſt of Gods gifts to man-kind, who come <hi>not</hi> to <hi>condemne the world,</hi> but that <hi>the world through him might be ſaved, Iohn</hi> 3.17. I ſay, it renders the coming of Chriſt to be the only cauſe of a horrible Judgement, without the leaſt mixture of mercy, upon the bodies of thoſe men, whoſe ſouls were caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; that is to ſay, Chriſt by his coming raiſes their bodies from the grave, where they were without the fence of any miſery, and caſts them (without any cauſe) into everlaſting torments.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170393:17"/>
               <p>Secondly, the imagination falls upon the account of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. ſhewing that that death which came by that one man, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, <hi>paſſed upon all;</hi> wherefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant an eternal death upon the ſouls of men, for that paſſed not upon the ſouls of the holy Fathers, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And thus you may ſee, that neither of theſe imaginations can ſtand either according to Scripture, or Reaſon; and therefore the truth only remains before you, as clearly proved by theſe conſiderations, namely, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin brought but the firſt death, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that mens loving darkneſs rather then the light, is the cauſe of a ſecond death; and this may not be rejected, becauſe Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, <hi>
                     <hi>This</hi> is the condemnation, Iohn</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin brought but the firſt death as aforeſaid, alſo appeareth from the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is plainly held forth, that Chriſt will bring <hi>all</hi> men to a reſurrection from that death which comes upon <hi>all</hi> men by the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; wherefore it cannot poſſibly be the ſecond death which he ſpeaks of as brought by <hi>Adam:</hi> for then it ſuppoſes <hi>all</hi> men brought to a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the ſecond death, or Hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo preaches general ſalvation,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170393:17"/>which is folly to conceive: ſo then, (with the Prophet) I conclude, that the <hi>Son</hi> ſhall not die <hi>eternally</hi> for the <hi>iniquity</hi> of the <hi>Father, But the righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him;</hi> (that is to ſay, upon him alone, and not his child, ſo as to bring it to eternal life) <hi>And the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him;</hi> (that is upon him alone, and not his child, ſo as to bring it to eternall death, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20.</p>
               <p>Well then, by this time 'tis neceſſary to mind again our Queſtion; namely, <hi>That if Chriſt died for all men, How is it that all are not ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, by what hath been ſaid, you may ſee in what ſtate man was in by his firſt Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even out of Gods favour, and in a ſtate of miſery condemned to the firſt death; <hi>But God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son to taſte death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. and ſo deſtroyes him that hath the power of death, (that is the devil;) And thus there is purchaſed (by Chriſt) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection for all men from the firſt death, with the gift of God, which is eternal life: (and hence it is, that children dying in Infancy, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be condemned at the laſt day, <hi>for of ſuch is the kingdome of God, Mat.</hi> 19.14.) But now men (having a being here through Chriſt) come to rebell againſt God, and going out of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170393:18"/>the way, ſo as there is <hi>none righteous, no not one, Rom.</hi> 3.12. they become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath; but ſuch is the love of God, that he followes the creature with mercy, commanding the Goſpel to be preached to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature, which Goſpel men not believing, the <hi>wrath of God abideth on them, John</hi> 3.36. the light of eternal life, and remiſſion of ſins in Jeſus is held forth, <hi>but men loves darkneſs rather then light;</hi> the prize of glory is put into their hands, but they (like fooles) have no heart to it; and ſo, whereas the Objector asketh, how it is that all are not ſaved, if Chriſt dyed for all; the anſwer is in Chriſts words, <hi>
                     <hi>This is thecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> John</hi> 3.19. <hi>that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I judge that the ſeeming ſhow of the objection vaniſheth, and that the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in its power, and plainneſs, namely; That Chriſt died for all men; and ſo ſetteth all men in a way in which they may come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved; The truth of which will appear, if you ſhall take a view of the Scriptures, ſpeaking of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from the beginning; as firſt, in the very day that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, Chriſt was promiſed by God, ſaying, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head:</hi> and it is ſaid of <hi>Abell, That
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170393:18"/>by faith he offered a more excellent ſacrifice, then Cain, Heb.</hi> 11.4. Shewing plainly, that <hi>Abell</hi> was enlightened touching the promiſed ſeed, to wit, Chriſt the true Sacrifice, in whom he believing, his ſacrifice became more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then that of <hi>Cain:</hi> alſo it is ſaid of <hi>Enoch, that by faith he was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death;</hi> and before his tranſlation he had this teſtimony, <hi>that he pleaſed God;</hi> and not only ſo, but himſelf being enlightned touching Chriſt, we find that he Propheſieth alſo of the coming of Chriſt, with his faints to Judgement, <hi>Jude</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And ſo he was a preacher of the Goſpel to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in his, and following Generations. In like manner we find <hi>Noah</hi> declared to be a preacher of Righteouſneſs, and by Faith preparedan Ark, whereby he <hi>Condemned</hi> the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. All which ſhewes, that <hi>Noah</hi> was ſuch an eminent light in his Generation, that the whole world (then in being) was ſo taught, and inſtructed by him, (he being a Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) as that (they being diſobedient thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) are ſaid thereby to be condemned. Alſo we find very cleerly, that the Goſpel was Preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed, Gal.</hi> 3.8. And afterwards
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170393:19"/>unto his ſeed, (the children of Iſrael) in the wilderneſs, as appeareth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. Among which people God ſhewed ſuch mighty, and wonderful power in ſaving, and delivering them, and deſtroying their enemies, as that thereby he declared to all the World, that he was Iſraels God, and approved of their Faith, and Worſhip; as to inſtance ſome of many, <hi>The Angel ſmote of the Campe of the Aſſyrians, an hundred four ſcore and five thouſand,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.35. Alſo God delivering <hi>Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednigo</hi> from the <hi>fiery Furnace;</hi> as alſo <hi>Daniel</hi> being delivered from the <hi>Lions den;</hi> decrees were made, that <hi>
                     <hi>Every</hi> People, Nation, and language, ſhould tremble and fear before their God,</hi> and that <hi>his Kingdome ſhall never have an end, Dan.</hi> 3.29.6.26. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Lord bringing his people out of the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſtirred up the ſpirit of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to make Proclamation in all the Kingdomes of the earth, that he was to build him (the only true God) a houſe at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.1, 2. Beſides all ſuch kinds of preaching, there was among them a continual Miniſtry of the holy Prophets, whoſe <hi>words,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) went unto the <hi>ends</hi> of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. by which means ſome of every Nation under heaven were proſelyted, devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhiping the true God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.5.9, 10,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170393:19"/>11. And as God was preſent with the houſe of Iſrael in power and might as aforeſaid; ſo alſo in giving great and wonderful wiſdome, ſo that the <hi>Queen</hi> of the <hi>South,</hi> came from the <hi>uttermoſt parts</hi> of the earth, to hear the wiſdome of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Mat.</hi> 12.42. yea, and <hi>all</hi> the Kings of the earth ſought his preſence, to hear the wiſdome that God had put in his heart, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 9.23. By this cloud of witneſſes, 'tis manifeſt, that the Goſpel was made known to all people in all Generations down to the Apoſtles, in whoſe Generation, Chriſt commanded the Goſpel to be preached to every creature, and ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, it was preached to every creature under Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. And ſo it is evident, that God ſet all men, at all times, in a way by the Goſpel, that they might come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Though it be true, that the Goſpel was preached among the Nations, yet we cannot judge that they all had, or that all people now have a ſufficiency of means, whereby to believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That all men had, and have a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of means ſo as to beleeve, and be ſaved, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and to you will appear if you keep well in your minds the agreement of Gods Attributes, ſo as that they may ſweetly meet, and kiſs each other in all that you beleeve; for you know the Scriptures holds forth, That God is <hi>not willing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170393:20"/>that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance;</hi> yea, and ſweareth by himſelf, that <hi>he deſires not the death of the wicked, but rather that he turn, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. Now all the means of Repentance, and Faith, and the grace to keep men from periſhing, is from God, as you alſo confeſs, for him therefore to with-hold the means of Salvation from the poor creatures, whereby 'tis altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them ever to miſs eternally periſhing; yet nevertheleſs to ſay, that he is long-ſuffering, and not willing that <hi>Any</hi> ſhould periſh, yea, and to ſwear that he deſires not the death of the wicked; affectionately ſaying to them, <hi>Turn yee, turn yee; for why <hi>will yee</hi> dye?</hi> Whenas himſelf with-holds the means, without which they cannot return, and live; I ſay, for God thus to ſay, and ſwear, is altogether incredible, being that which calls in queſtion the Attributes of the Almighty; and indeed is proper <hi>only</hi> to an unjuſt, deceitful man, and not to God: ſo then 'tis plain, that as God deſireth the Salvation of men, (and ſweareth that he wills not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation) ſo he affordeth a ſufficiency of means in order thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there is a ſufficiency of means for all, appears, becauſe Chriſt charges perſons not coming to him, ſo as to beleeve in him, upon the obſtinacy of <hi>their wills,</hi> and not upon the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170393:20"/>want of means, as appeareth by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>
                     <hi>Yee will</hi> not come unto me that ye might have life, Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, How oft would I have gathered thy Children, but <hi>ye would</hi> not,</hi> Joh. 4.48. <hi>Except ye ſee ſigns, and wonders, <hi>ye will</hi> not beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It appears alſo to be ſo, becauſe thoſe who are ſaid to periſh, ſhall be leſt without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or claok for their ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22. Which cannot be, in caſe they alwayes wanted means, or ability to beleeve, for of all cloaks, or excuſes that poſſibly can be, what is a greater, or ſafer excuſe, then an impoſſibility to do the thing required? Yea ſurely, it will be a fair plea before the Juſt, and Righteous God; but God <hi>will judge all men according to their works;</hi> therefore no ſuch excuſe or piea.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Scriptures ſaith, that Chriſt <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled</hi> at the unbelief of ſome, (as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and alſo pronounceth condemnation to the unbeleever, <hi>becauſe</hi> he beleeveth not, &amp;c. Which may clearly prove to them, that honour God in all his Attributes, that he allowes a ſufficiency of means to every man, to do the thing which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: unleſs it may be ſafe to conceive, that Chriſt (the wiſdome of God) did marvel at known impoſſibilites, and alſo that he will plunge men into hell for ever; for not doing that, which himſelf <hi>only</hi> worketh in the creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170393:21"/>but God forbid ſuch horrible blindneſs.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt commands men to <hi>beleeve in the Light,</hi> while <hi>they have the Light, that they may be the children of Light,</hi> Joh. 12.36. Now for a man to be exhorted to beleeve in the Light, that he may be a child of the Light; and he in ſuch darkneſs as was the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and as unable to help himſelf out of it as they were; would be a moſt unwiſe, vain, and deceitful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; unwiſe, and vain, it being known he could never beleeve; deceitful, in pretending that he might be the Child of Light, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unpoſſible: wherefore ſtill I conclude, that Chriſts words are pure, and unfained, and ſo men every way made able through grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and do the things which they are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto: Chriſt the Lord (whom we ſerve) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hard Maſter.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, while men are treating about what means God doth allow in order to the doing his will; himſelf comes in, and pleads, <hi>What could I have done <hi>More,</hi> that I have not done?</hi> And yet will any man dare to ſay, that he had done <hi>Nothing</hi> in order to their Salvation? as he had not if he never made them able to beleeve: Oh do not ſay ſo, for in ſo doing, you will grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin againſt God; who allowed ſuch a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of means, as that (in his wiſdome) he <hi>looked</hi> for that to be done which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170393:21"/>What, did he look for that which could not be? and alſo enter into judgment with them, laying them waſt, and giving them up to blinded eyes, and hardned hearts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4, 6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. as a recompence unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.9. From all which I conclude, that Jeſus Chriſt taſted death for <hi>every man,</hi> and that <hi>All</hi> men <hi>Every Where</hi> may <hi>repent,</hi> as they are commanded by him who is no hard Maſter; and that <hi>All</hi> men <hi>
                     <hi>might</hi> beleeve;</hi> as in plain words is written, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as 'tis conceived, that the one part of mankind have not a ſufficiency of means to beleeve, and ſo periſh: ſo alſo the other part of mankind have an irreſiſtible means making them to beleeve, and ſo they are ſaved. The latter of which is as inconſiſtent to truth, as the former, as lively appeareth from Chriſts words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.23, 24. ſaying, That it is <hi>eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of an Needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> For all cannot but know, that if God be the alone Agent in, and about mans conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and his ordinary way be to work irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly therein; all (I ſay) cannot but know that it is <hi>Alike</hi> eaſie for him to convert a rich man as a poor man. And beſides, if Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way to convert men be to work irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibly, how he could appeal to <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170393:22"/>to your ſence, knew that this was his way) ſaying; <hi>what could I have done <hi>More,</hi> which I have not done?</hi> Whenas he had not wrought ſo much as in his ordinary way upon them; I judge no man can give a reaſonable account to this. Therefore in brief I conclude, (in oppoſition to all thoſe that imagine Gods ordinary way to convert men is unreſiſtible) with <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ye do alwayes <hi>reſiſt</hi> the holy Spirit, as your fathers did, ſo do ye, Act.</hi> 7.51. and with the words of the Lord, <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with bonds of love, yet they <hi>refuſed</hi> to return, Hoſea.</hi> 11.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But this which you have ſaid, ſeems to croſs the way of Gods Election, and reprobation, from the beginning; whoſe way is to hate ſome men before they have done either good, or evil; as is plainly held forth in that of</hi> Eſau; <hi>and ſo impoſſible for them ever to beleeve, and be ſaved;</hi> For he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the better underſtanding of this Point, well conſider the principal thing, which <hi>Paul</hi> treats of in that Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. which is, that the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are not the children of promiſe, or the Elect of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. wherefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) though <hi>Eſau</hi> was the child of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and that upon <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſide too, yet God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170393:22"/>hated him: therefore you Jewes that ſtand ſo much upon your brith priviledges, as being the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, by this of <hi>Eſau</hi> you may know, that it will not prove you to be the Elect of God, but you may be hated as <hi>Eſau</hi> was, he being as truly a child of <hi>Abraham</hi> as you, but for his wickedneſs, (whether conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Perſon, or as a Nation) God rejected him; I ſay, for his wickedneſs as appeareth, <hi>Obad.</hi> 9.10. <hi>For thy violence, (O Eſau) againſt thy brother Jacob, ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever, Mal.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17. <hi>Eſaus</hi> wickedneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (whether conſidered a perſon, or a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) I ſay, with the holy Prophets, was the cauſe why God hated him; whoſe wickedneſs, God that foreknoweth all things, foreknew in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca's</hi> time, and thereupon ſaid to her, <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> the <hi>elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> which ſaying <hi>Paul</hi> being acquainted with, ſpake theſe words; to wit, <hi>That the children being not yet born, neither having done any good, or evil, that the purpoſe of God, according to Election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth;</hi> it was ſaid unto her, as aforeſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. ſhewing thereby, that God was ſo mindful, that his pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe according to Election might ſtand; (which the Jewes ſo mightily oppoſed) that he ſignified ſo long ago as <hi>Rebecca's</hi> time, before the children
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170393:23"/>were born, or had done either good or evil, that <hi>(Eſau)</hi> the elder, (foreſeen to be wicked) ſhould ſerve <hi>(Jacob)</hi> the younger, for his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt him; as (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Obadiah</hi> 9.10.) And therefore this Election by grace, (as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay) which I contend for, being as ancient as the Fathers, ſpoken of by God himſelf to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> you may in no wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for I preach no new thing.</p>
               <p>But alas, how is it, that men ſo ſtumble at theſe words ſpoken by <hi>Paul</hi> in this ninth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as if God hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, without reſpect unto his foreſeen wickedneſs, as the cauſe thereof? I ſay, how is it, that you ſo conceive, and thus ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine vain things? for doth it in the leaſt follow, that God ſo hated him, becauſe 'tis ſaid (if that might be granted) he hated him before he was born, or had done any evil? ſurely no: unleſs it could be found, that God hated him alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done evil, without reſpect to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen evil, in which is the main Controverſie; and not ſo much whether God hated <hi>Eſau</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was born, or had done evil, yea, or nay; but rather what was the cauſe for which he was hated, to which this Text (in the <hi>Romans</hi>) doth not at all ſpeak, only ſpeaks of the time, to wit, <hi>before the Children were borne,</hi> &amp;c. But as touching the cauſe wherein is our great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170393:23"/>I tell you again, the text ſpeaks not; wherefore it remaineth that you diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind other Scriptures, which ſpeaks as to the cauſe thereof, which plainly tels you, that <hi>Eſau's</hi> violence &amp;c: was the cauſe, <hi>Obad.</hi> 9.10. Now although this be ſpoken of him after he had perſonally tranſgreſſed, yet I queſtion not but that you with me will acknowledge, that all his tranſgreſſions was known to God in <hi>Rebecba's</hi> time, (as alſo before) which if ſo, Why may it not be thus? for what is ſaid in this place to the <hi>Romans,</hi> namely, that God foreſeeing <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Edoms</hi> wickedneſs in <hi>Rebecca's</hi> time, ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, the <hi>elder ſhall ſerve the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> yea verily, 'tis plain, that God did ſpeak to her upon the account of foreknowledge, for faith he; <hi>Two <hi>Nations</hi> are in thy wombe, Gen.</hi> 25.23. which all cannot but know was no otherwiſe, but as God foreſaw two Nations proceeding from the two Children, which only was in <hi>Rebecca's</hi> womb; and ſo alſo God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth things that are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p>Further, to what you ſay, touching God <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I freely grant it, but the Controverſie is, whom God hath mercy on, and that is, beleeving men; and whom it is God hardneth, and that is, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170393:24"/>unbeleeving men; (though they be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, that is after the fleſh.) And this I believe was Gods righteous dealings in all ages; that is to ſay, God firſt manifeſted his tender loving kindneſs to them, with much long patience, and gentleneſs, waiting upon them in the uſe of means, bidding them to open their <hi>mouths wide,</hi> &amp; he would fill it; but thoſe that will not <hi>hearken,</hi> but <hi>reject</hi> his <hi>counſell, <hi>So</hi>
                  </hi> God gives them <hi>up to their own hearts luſts, Pſal.</hi> 81.10, 11, 12. <hi>So,</hi> that which ſhould have been for their welfare, is become their trap, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. God blinds their eyes, layes ſtumbling blocks before them, gives them up to hardneſs of heart, and Reprobates them for ever, as a recompence to them, for their wilful rebellion; the <hi>Only</hi> cauſe thereof, as preacheth this vein of Scriptures, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.16, 17, 21. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21, 26. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I lay before you, becauſe the queſtion is, wherefore God hardens mens hearts; and not, whether he doth harden mens hearts, yea, or nay. For I do (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes did grant that; and the cauſe thereof is as aforeſaid; namely, the creatures nelgect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and putting from them ſo great ſalvation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170393:24"/>as is freely tendered in Jeſus, when as they ought to receive it with love thereunto; <hi>For <hi>This Cauſe,</hi>
                  </hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleive a lye; that ſo they might be damned, <hi>Becauſe</hi> they received not the love of the truth, that they <hi>might</hi> be ſaved,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. according to which all Nations are in the hand of God, as clay in the hand of the Potter, and ſo at what inſtant ſoever, God ſpeaketh unto a people, ſhewing them, through the Goſpel, that his pleaſure is to <hi>build,</hi> and <hi>plant</hi> them, and ſo make them <hi>veſſels</hi> for honour; if that people do <hi>evill</hi> in his <hi>ſight,</hi> that they <hi>obey</hi> not his voice of good-will towards them, and ſo <hi>Marr</hi> themſelves, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6.) in the hand of God, he then <hi>repenteth</hi> of the good where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſaid he <hi>would</hi> benefit <hi>them, Ier.</hi> 18.4, 9, 10. ſo he gives them up to hardneſs of heart, ſo they become veſſels for diſhonour; when as others of the ſame lump, turning from the evil of their wayes, God maketh them veſſels for honour, and ſo of the ſame lump one veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell for honour, and another for diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>But if not withſtanding you ſhall yet turn the body of theſe Scriptures otherways, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold its face; namely, That God did (before time) hate the greateſt part of the world, without
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170393:25"/>reſpect unto foreſeen wickedneſs as the cauſ ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that (in time) he gives them up to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, (without grace at any time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be ſaved,) and at the day of Judgement will caſt them into everlaſting Torments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their wickedneſs and hardneſs of heart; and yet declare in his Word, (which you ſay is a word of truth) that he is <hi>good</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> and that his <hi>tender mercies are over <hi>all</hi> his works; that he is ſlow to anger, and of great mercy,</hi> Pſa. 145.8, 9. <hi>Patient, long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. <hi>Not willing that <hi>Any</hi> ſhould periſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. ſwearing by himſelf, <hi>that he deſireth not the death of the wicked,</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>but would have all men ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 24. <hi>Forty years long griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the iniquity of his people,</hi> Heb. 3.17. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning</hi> their <hi>undone eſtate, Pſal.</hi> 81.13. yea, even <hi>weeping</hi> for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. ſaying. <hi>What could I have done more,</hi> (for your good) <hi>that I have not done? Iſa.</hi> 5.4. when as he knew, (according to your Tenent) that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſhut them up from all poſſibilities of believing unto Salvation, and that by his own, unreſiſtible Decree, and purpoſe of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Judge ye (friends) in this cauſe, and judge righteous judgement, and with fear, and trembling, weigh theſe things.</p>
               <p>To return a little to the objection again;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170393:25"/>ſider further, that though Thave proved that <hi>Eſau's</hi> wickedneſs, and ſo the wickedneſs of all wicked men, was, (and is) the cauſe for which the Decree of Reprobation took hold of them; yet (miſtake not for) I do not ſay, that 'twas fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen wickedneſs in them, that was the moving cauſe in God to <hi>Make</hi> the Decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather the unutterable purity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wordable holineſs dwelling in himſelf, (which poſſibly could not admit of any wicked creature in his preſence.) This I ſay moved him to <hi>Make</hi> the Decree, that all wickedneſs might be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from happineſs in his preſence.</p>
               <p>So having ſpoken of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and how he, and all other wicked men are reprobated to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it remains that I now ſpeak of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and how he, and all other righteous men are elected to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, I beleeve that God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son to die for the world, whenas there was nothing in the world that did, or could move him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the world being gone all out of the way, and coming ſhort of Gods glory, God did purpoſe a gracious purpoſe of Election in Chriſt; namely, to chuſe, or ſet apart beleeving men for glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> (with all other beleeving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170393:26"/>men) being found in Chriſt, Gods gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and decree of Election takes hold of them, being ſuch as are Elected from the foundation of the world to eternal Salvation; but by this (take notice) I do not ſay, that God foreſeeing faith in <hi>Jacob,</hi> or in any other, was thereby moved to <hi>Make</hi> that decree of Election, as if the works of righteouſneſs which we have done, firſt moved him ſo graciouſly to purpoſe, and decree for the good of beleeving men; I ſay not ſo, but rather the meer love, and compaſſion dwelling in God himſelf, moved him to purpoſe, and Elect beleevers in Chriſt to Salvation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Apoſtles words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> ver. 9. purpoſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. nothing of worth in man firſt, or laſt moving him thereunto; and ſo our Salvation is of God, that ſheweth mercy upon them that beleeve. And whereas this purpoſe reacheth in the beleever in Chriſt only, 'tis not becauſe God ſaw ſuch a worth, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving excellency in the creatures beleeving, but that he might (in ſhewing mercy unto men) not deſtroy his attributes, as of honour, and juſtice, which would have been blemiſhed, had he choſen the unbeleeving, ſinful man for himſelf, having before caſt man out of his preſence for ſin: &amp; ſo though the beleever only hath intereſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170393:26"/>in Gods purpoſe of Election, yet the cauſe of his happineſs is the tender love, and compaſſions of God, dwelling originally in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Where then is boſting? It is excluded; by what law? by the law of Faith, for as much as Chriſt, who is the object of faith, is the meer gift of God, who alſo hath from of old decreed. <hi>from</hi> the meer grace dwelling in himſelf, and <hi>not from</hi> foreſeen faith in the creature, to Elect, and chuſe men unto Salvation, <hi>through</hi> (not <hi>for</hi>) the <hi>belief of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. whoſe belief alſo cometh by hearing the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is to be preached to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>for the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. So then, all being of him, and through him, not unto us, not unto us in the leaſt, but to the Lord alone be glory for ever.</p>
               <p>The next thing which I purpoſe, is ſomewhat touching the two Covenants, becauſe I find that ſome ſtumble for want of a right underſtanding the old, and other ſome for want of a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the new Covenant, wherefore for the good of each, this I declare, head it well I pray you.</p>
               <p>You I mean that ſtumble about the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, for have you not read, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>two Sons,</hi> the one by a <hi>Bond-maid,</hi> the other by a <hi>Free-woman:</hi> which things (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) are an allegory, for they are the two Covenants; the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170393:27"/>one from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which is <hi>Hagar,</hi> who (you may remember) did abide with her ſon <hi>Iſhmael</hi> for a time in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family; but when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne, and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> found mocking at him, he no longer muſt abide there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9, 10. but <hi>Sarah</hi> a Free-woman, and her ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> a child of Promiſe, who indeed had more right to dwell in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, then ſhe that was a meer Bond-woman, and her ſon born after the fleſh. Now being told by <hi>Paul,</hi> that theſe are the two Covenants, it followes plainly, that as there was a time for <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to abide in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, but muſt be caſt out when found mocking at the true promiſed ſeed according to the fleſh; ſo there was a time, when the firſt Covenant, and her children after the fleſh, (held forth by <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi>) had a being in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, but at length being found mocking at the new Covenant, and her children after the promiſe, muſt be caſt out; ſo the new Covenant remains, and her children (held forth by <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>) with whom the Bond-woman, and her ſon ſhall not be heir.</p>
               <p>But that you may the more cleerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the caſting out of the firſt Covenant, and her Children; Firſt, mind what the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is: and that is in a ſtrict ſence, the ten Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, written upon the Tables of Stone, <hi>Exod.</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170393:27"/>34.28, 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4. And in the largeſt ſence the whole law of <hi>Moſes</hi> given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt, Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19, 20, 22. And thoſe who were accounted children of this firſt Covenant, or Teſtament, were the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, deſcending from <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.32, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.3, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1, 2. For they all were borne Heirs of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo were commanded to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that the Token of the Covenant might be in the fleſh; the truth of which is undeniably held forth by that touching <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> (as hath been ſaid) whom the Apoſtle ſaith, ſignifieth the firſt Covenant, and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23, 24, 25. Whereupon if <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the ſon of a Bond-woman, born after the fleſh, hold forth the Children of the firſt Covenant, which gendered to bondage; it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh, were the children thereof; therefore (ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) caſt out the Bond-woman, and her Son, (which ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> allegorically is the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and her children) who ſhall not be Heir with the ſon of the Free-woman; that is to ſay, the children of the new Covenant; now moſt ſure I am, that if they were not fleſhly, (but Spiritual) they ſhould not be caſt out,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170393:28"/>though by this I do not deny, but that many of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh did become, through beleiving, everlaſtingly happy, but not by the law, or firſt Covenant, the tenor of which is, <hi>Do, and thou ſhalt live, Rom.</hi> 10.5. but by the law of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. which excludeth boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in birth previledges. So then the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was made with the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Prieſt-hood given to a fleſhly line, (the ſeed of <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 40.14, 15. <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.62.) the Sacrifices and Ordinances carnal, that is, fleſhly, ſeeming for the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10, 13. that they might ſtand before God, and not die, and enjoy the good land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God Covenanted to give to them, as they were the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the nature, or tenor of the firſt (or old) Covenant (as in the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi>) was this; to wit, <hi>He that <hi>Doth</hi> theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> (that is, ſhould be bleſſed with long life, deliverance from all their enemies, with all other temporal bleſſings in the promiſed Land, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. the nature of which law, <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth in direct oppoſition to the law of faith, which (ſaith he) ſpeaketh on this wiſe; <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt <hi>Believe</hi> in thy heart, that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.5, 6, 9. And hence it is, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeeking after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170393:28"/>righteouſneſs as it were by the works of the law ſtumbled, and fell, ſhewing plainly, that the righteouſneſs, which takes hold of eternal life, was not attainable by the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. for the law is not of faith, and ſo 'tis evident, that no fleſh ſhall be juſtified by it in the ſight of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the tenor of the Law, as in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was, <hi>
                     <hi>Do,</hi> and thou ſhalt live;</hi> and ſo the Law, or firſt Covenant in that ſence leading to bondage, (anſwering the Bond-woman) is caſt out, with her fleſhly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (anſwering <hi>Iſhmael, Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh) and <hi>So</hi> it comes to paſs, that <hi>Paul</hi> in plain words declareth, that the Law written, and <hi>engraven <hi>in ſtones,</hi>
                  </hi> is done away, and <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 11, 13. Alſo ſaith the Apoſtle, he taketh away the <hi>firſt</hi> that he may eſtabliſh the the <hi>ſecond, Heb.</hi> 10 9.</p>
               <p>But miſtake not, for by this I do not import as if Chriſt came to deſtroy the Law, but rather to fulfill, and eſtabliſh it: yea and now alſo the Law, ſo far as 'tis miniſtred in by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (by Saints) as a righteous rule, in the doing of which God may have honour; but mind I pray you, the vaſt difference betwixt doing the law as miniſtred by <hi>Moſes,</hi> from doing the Law as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by <hi>Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as thus, <hi>Do</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) and thou ſhalt live:</hi> but, <hi>Believe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170393:29"/>
                  <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt <hi>live;</hi> and ſo when the creature comes to believe, and in believing hath life, he then having life, is to do whatſoever Chriſt teacheth him of the Law, as alſo all other things which he ſhall require him to do for the honour of his, and the Fathers name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 31. in the doing of which, Chriſt ſaith he ſhall <hi>abide</hi> in his love, <hi>John</hi> 15.10. But if he waxe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and come to diſhonour the father, and the Son, who hath given him life in believing, in his treſpaſſe which he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin which he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he dye.</p>
               <p>All this being conſidered ſerves (by the way) firſt to remove the conſcientious ſcruple riſen in ſome, touching the now remaining of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath; for while they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how it can be that one of the ten Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſhould be taken away, and the other nine remain, the truth offers it ſelf in, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they all are done away, as miniſtred in the old Covenant by <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 11, 13. though remaining ſo far, and upon the account, as Chriſt teacheth them, who is the great, and alone Prophet, that is to be heard in all things whatſoever, <hi>He</hi> ſhall ſay to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerves for ſharpe reprooſe to thoſe who would be looked upon zealous for God, in that they contend for the ſprinkling of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170393:29"/>infants: for if the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are caſt out, and ſo not admitted as members of the new Teſtament, or Church of Chriſt, meerly as ſuch; (upon which account <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, put back the Phariſees from his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as not fit members for the Church of Chriſt, upon their plea of having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9.) how lame, weak, frothy, carnall, and confuſed a thing is it to receive little children into the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, upon the plea, that they are the ſeed of Believers; What! all the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful caſt out, and yet labour to receive in the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children? be aſhamed hereof, O ye Prieſts, for the Lord will not hold them guiltleſs that makes void his Commandements by their own traditions. But more to this elſewhere, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6. Now to return.</p>
               <p>The ſum of all is (as the Apoſtle ſaith) the Bond-woman, and her ſon, that is to ſay, the firſt Covenant and its children, is caſt out, ever ſince the death, and reſurrection of Chriſt, ſo henceforth <hi>know we no man after the fleſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. becauſe the ſon of the Bond-woman (<hi>Iſhmael</hi> after the fleſh) ſhall not be heir with <hi>(Iſaac)</hi> the ſon of the free-woman; that is to ſay, with the children of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or new Teſtament: wherefore it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170393:30"/>in the next place, to conſider what the new Covenant is, and who are the children thereof; ſince they only are heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>The New Covenant, or New Teſtament, is in the ſtricteſt ſence, that which is written in the 31 of <hi>Jer.</hi> 33, 34. verſ. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. And in the largeſt ſence, the Goſpel, the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tydings, way, and ordinances thereof, as 'tis written in the books of the new Teſtament, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was a Miniſter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Now the Children of the New Covenant are penitent, believing, obedient men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuch as are born again, <hi>not of blood nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, John</hi> 1.13. New creatures, and theſe are the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the ſpirit, and heirs according to promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. And with them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſuch, God makes, or enters into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, giving them his ſpirit, and ſo puts his <hi>Laws</hi> in their <hi>minds,</hi> and writes them in their <hi>hearts:</hi> and ſo he is a <hi>God</hi> unto <hi>them,</hi> and they <hi>only</hi> are <hi>his people,</hi> Heb. 8.10. <hi>And ſo they need not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother; ſaying, know the Lord; for all ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt of them, verſe</hi> 11. But miſtake not, though all the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170393:30"/>children of the New Covenant need not to teach one another, ſo as to know the Lord, yet they ought to build, up one another, in the knowledge of the Lord, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts from the Lord, they are to teach one another to grow in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, exhorting one another, and ſo much the more as they ſee the day of Chriſt approaching; ſo by uſing of their gifts, they come to be eſtabliſhed, and go on to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 14. and 10.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Lord will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins, and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will he remember no more, ſo that they may have free acceſſe to him through Chriſt, he being ſacrificed for them; ſo that there is no need of a ſacrifice as there was under the old Teſtament, for then there was a continual ſacrificing, and ſo a remembrance of ſin every year, and ſo the comers thereunto could not be made perfect, for it was not poſſible that the blood of Buls and Goats ſhould take away ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. But Chriſt being come, by one <hi>offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified;</hi> ſo he takes away the firſt Covenant, that he might eſtabliſh the Second, that the children of the ſecond Covenant might ſtand before God, and die not, having a new
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170393:31"/>and living way which he hath conſecrated, or made through the offering of the <hi>Body</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt once for all; and ſo they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord with boldneſs, yea, enter into the holieſt by the <hi>Blood</hi> of Jeſus; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an High Preiſt over the houſe of God, draw neer with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith, having their hearts ſprinkled from an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and their body waſhed in pure water, <hi>Heb,</hi> 10.9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>So then the children of the New Covenant have free <hi>acceſſe</hi> to God, worſhipping of him in <hi>ſpirit, and in truth</hi> acceptably, without any ſacrifice, as after the Law, or old Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that being aboliſhed and done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, 13. ſo ſin is not remembred, and ſo they ſhall be eternally ſaved, if they hold <hi>faſt the profeſſion of their faith without wavering to the end;</hi> but if they ſin wilfully, <hi>there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more ſacrifice for ſins; but a <hi>Certaine fearfull</hi> looking for of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and fiery indignation; which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adverſaries; he that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes, of how much ſorer <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſuppoſe yee ſhall he be thought <hi>worthy,</hi> who hath <hi>troden under foot the ſon of God, and hath count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing; and hath done
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170393:31"/>deſpight unto the Spirit of grace,</hi> verſe 23, 26, 27, 28.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Miniſters of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, are not by a fleſhly line, as the Preiſts of the old Teſtament were; the ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> born by Generation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.40. But they are made Miniſters of the new Covenant meerly by gifts given from God, as appeareth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 8, 11. where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that the Lord Jeſus <hi>aſcended up on high, and gave gifts to men;</hi> he gave <hi>ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, and Teachers; for the gathering together of the Saints, for the <hi>Work of the Miniſtry;</hi> for the edification of the body of Chriſt; till we <hi>all</hi> meet together in the unity of the faith; and knowledge of the ſon of God, unto a perfect man, and unto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſs of Chriſt, verſ.</hi> 12, 13. So then it is cleer from hence, that all the Miniſters, or Preachers of the new Teſtament, are to preach or teach by gifts given from God, for they have gifts given for the work of the Miniſtry, and that in all ages till Chriſt comes; for all the ſaints cannot meet together in the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, not untill Chriſt his coming; therefore the whole work of the Miniſtry is, to be performed by men gifted of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170393:32"/>God in all ages, and not by men of a fleſhly generation, line, or by any humane learned Arts, for that is contrary to the new Covenant, for all her children are taught of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And this will further appear, becauſe (as the Apoſtle ſheweth) <hi>the world by wiſdome knew not God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Nor if all the humane arts in the world did not teach the knowledge of God, it followeth that all humane Arts cannot inable a man to preach, or declare the Goſpel, the unſearchable riches that is in Chriſt; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> though learned, ignorantly perſecutes the Church of Chriſt; but by grace given him, he was made able to preach the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Jeſus rejoyced</hi> in Spirit, and <hi>gives thanks</hi> to his Father, that he had hid the <hi>things of the Goſpel,</hi> or new Covenant, <hi>from the wiſe and prudent, or learned, and revealed them to Babes,</hi> Luke 10.21. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith; <hi>That the viſion of all is become as a book that is ſealed;</hi> So that the learned and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cannot read it; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.11, 12. From all which it plaineth appeareth, that all Miniſters of the new Covenant, are made able for the work of the Miniſtery, through the ſpirit, grace and gift of God; for the <hi>ſpiritual man judgeth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170393:32"/>all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10, 15. And ſo God hath not choſen the <hi>mighty men,</hi> or things of the world, which are highly eſteemed among men, but chuſeth the <hi>poor, fooliſh, weak, baſe, deſpiſed things, things that are not, to bring to nought things that are; <hi>That</hi> no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27, 28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.15.</p>
               <p>So then mark well and ſee, the vaſt diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Old Covenant and the New, the Old was of works, <hi>do and live long,</hi> ſo they doing it, Juſtification would have been of dept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. but the New is, <hi>Believe and live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,</hi> So Juſtification is by faith, that it might be by grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. The Old Covenant is litteral and killeth, becauſe all have broken it, but the new Covenant, is ſpiritual, and giveth life in Chriſt through beleeving, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. the Old was written in Tables of Stone, the New writeth the law of God in the heart; the ſons and daughters of the Old Covenant, were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh; the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the new Covenant, are the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> after the ſpirit, new borne, new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; God according to the Old Covenant, did know and chuſe the family of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, above all the families of the earth, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. but now according to the new Covenant, he knoweth no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170393:33"/>man after the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 16. but every man of any Nation, that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. whether he be Jew or Gentile. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the old Covenant being after the fleſh by generation, there was need to teach them to know the Lord; but the Children of the new Covenant, need not to be taught to know the Lord; for they all know the Lord, from the leaſt to the greateſt of them, as it hath been ſhewed; The old Covenant, or law, though juſt, holy, and good, yet weak through the fleſh, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſtrength to Juſtifie the Children thereof; God finding fault with them, becauſe they had broken the Covenant, there was a place found for the new Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, ſo through <hi>Jeſus</hi> the High Prieſt and Mediatour of it, the Children thereof are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2, 3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8. The Sacrifices of the old covenant were carnal, fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the bloud of Buls and Goats, and ſo could not make the comers thereunto perfect; ſo there was a Remembrance of ſin every year, but the ſacrifice of the new Covenant, is the Lord from Heaven, the man Chriſt, his <hi>Blood</hi> being the blood of the new Covenant, being ſhed for <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. and ſo perfects for ever them that are ſanctified; which are the children of the new Covenant, ſo that their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170393:33"/>ſin is remembred no more, as it hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 14. the High Prieſt of the old Covenant was after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> by generation after a fleſhly line, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by the reaſon of death, but <hi>Jeſus</hi> the High Prieſt of the new Covenant, is after the order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> &amp; comes not to it by a fleſhly line after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> (as the Preiſts of the Law did) as touching his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Preiſt-hood, he is without father or mother, without kindred, and hath neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes, nor end of life, but remaineth a Prieft for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedec. <hi>So</hi>
                  </hi> he is able alſo <hi>perfectly</hi> to ſave them that come to God by him, (as the children of the new Covenant do) ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 24, 25. The Children of the old Covenant had bleſſings and promiſes after this manner; <hi>That the Lord would ſet them on high above all the Nations of the earth, bleſſed in the city, and in the field, bleſſed in the fruit of the body, flocks of ſheep, and heards of cattel, and deliverance from their enemies, and long life in the land of Canaan, withall the riches thereof, Deut.</hi> 28. The bleſſings of the new Covenant, are after this manner; <hi>deliverence from the evil of temptation;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Led into all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170393:34"/>truth, ſo as they</hi> experience that comfort, peace and joy that their names are <hi>written in the book of life, witneſſed by the holy ſpirit, all things working together for good, no condemnation, for they walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit;</hi> the promiſe of the <hi>life that now is,</hi> and of that which <hi>is to come, even eternal life,</hi> ſo as to <hi>reign in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, all may ſee, that they that go about to be juſtified by the Law, Written upon tables of ſtone, or the Law of ſacrifices, are fallen from grace; <hi>for if righteouſneſs be by the Law, then Chriſt died in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.21. and 5.4. But Chriſt died not in vain, but God is juſt, and the Juſtifier of him only that beleeveth in Jeſus, having that faith that worketh by love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. for ſuch only are the ſons and daughters of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>Alſo hence it clearly appeareth, how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Myſtery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, ſhe became ſo by bringing in a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal fleſhly ſeed, where <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh is caſt out, ſo ſhe goes a whoring, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a falſe carnal ſeed, inſtead of a true ſpiritual ſeed, ſhe bringeth in children into her Church, by baptizing them (as ſhe calleth it) and ſo the matter of her Church is meerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and her miniſtry by humane learning, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170393:34"/>not by gifts given from Chriſt, and yet talks of ſpiritual matter, confounding the Old Covenant with the New, and making the commandments of God of none effect by her many inventions; and ſo national Churches that ſprinkle their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, bring in a falſe fleſhly ſeed, and are her daughters, and ſo ſhe is truly ſaid to be Myſtery Babylon, or Confuſion, the mother of harlots, ſo ſhe going a whoring after her own inventions, ſhe hath made all <hi>Nations drunk</hi> with the <hi>wine</hi> of the <hi>wrath</hi> of <hi>herfornication, Rev.</hi> 2.5. and ſo according to that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.5. <hi>The earth is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed under the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the lawes, changed the ordinance, broken the everlaſting covenant, and therefore ſhe ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Rev. 17.16. <hi>And the curſe of the Lord God Almighty will devour the earth;</hi> Iſa. 24.6, 19, 20. wrath ſhall come upon the Gentile nations to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as it did upon the Jewes, yea, the Lord will make a full end of the Gentile nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. O that men would lay theſe things to heart, and hear, and obey the Lord according to the Goſpel, walking up orderly according to the new Teſtament in all things, in ſincerity of heart, that they might eſcape the things that ſhall come to paſſe, and to ſtand in Judgement before the Son of man, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36.</p>

               <p>And that ye may be ſons and daughters of God according to the New Teſtament in order, and ſo ſtand before the Lord with acceptance, obſerve well that the firſt Principle of the doctrine of Chriſt, is, <hi>Repentance from dead works, Heb.</hi> 6.1. For the Goſpel is to be preached to all, as it hath been ſhewed before, that men may repent of all their dead works; now repentance is a change of the mind, from all that which is evill, to all that which is good; it hath in it a hearty ſorrow for ſin, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin; and therefore <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt preaching Repentance, they came <hi>confeſſing their ſins, Math.</hi> 3. Repentance is ſuch a thing as changes the man from an evil converſation, to that which is very good; and alſo from all falſe whoriſh wayes of Worſhip, to the pure Worſhip of God; it hath in it theſe ſeven things; As firſt, it bringeth forth a continual care, as not to commit evil, nor to omit good, yea, a readineſs to every good work: ſecondly, clearing the matter of fact, if it be in wrong done to any man, by a wiſe juſt reſtitution, (if able) <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. and by doing ſo no more, what ever ſin it be, confeſſing it to God with brokenneſs of heart, turning from it. Thirdly, an inward indignation againſt all ſin. Fourthly, the ſear of God, which teacheth a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſiom evil and to have a ſingular reſpect to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170393:35"/>all the Commandements of the Lord, ſo as to do them. Fiftly, a vehement hungring, thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire after Righteouſneſs. Sixtly, a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous continuing in every good work. Seventhly, a holy revenge, in bringing the body under ſubjection by faſting, eſteeming the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord more then neceſſary food, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. And ſo it is repentance, or a change of the whole Man from dead works, <hi>for the wages of ſin is death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, that men may do works ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably in the ſight of God, the next Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or teaching of Chriſt unſeparably joyned with Repentance, is, <hi>Faith towards God;</hi> and that is, to <hi>beleeve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that dilligently ſeek him;</hi> and that Chriſt <hi>died for our ſins,</hi> and that <hi>he was buryed,</hi> and that <hi>he roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures;</hi> and that the blood of Chriſt, is, <hi>the <hi>Blood</hi> of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Shed</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and that there is <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> and a moſt <hi>glorious Kingdome,</hi> for <hi>all</hi> them that <hi>beleeve,</hi> and walk according to the Goſpel, or New Teſtament; and ſo Faith is the ſubſtance or ground of things which are <hi>hoped for,</hi> and the <hi>evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11.1, 6.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4.1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4, 6. yea this faith is of a purifying nature; for <hi>every one that hath this hope, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170393:36"/>himſelf as Chirſt is pure, Chap.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</p>
               <p>The next Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, is the Doctrine of <hi>Baptiſmes;</hi> it is ſaid to be <hi>Baptiſmes,</hi> becauſe there is a Baptiſme of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in a comparative ſence, in the which Chirſtians are dipped into, ſo as the waves goes over them, yet are raiſed out of it by the Lord; it is not every affliction, but ſome great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet this is common to Chriſtians, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.22, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.7. <hi>John</hi> 16.33.</p>
               <p>There is alſo Baptiſme or Dipping in Water, which is the one Baptiſme in a litterall ſence, which all Believers ought to practice; I ſay it is Dipping in Water, becauſe the word in the Greek holds forth a waſhing by dipping, and not ſprinkling, for it cannot be ſhewed in the Lexicons, as the learned confeſſe; and <hi>John Baptiſed in the River of Jordan; Mark</hi> 1.5. and Chriſt when he was Baptized, <hi>came up out of the water,</hi> of the river of Jordan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13.16. and <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch went down both into the water, and he baptized him in the water,</hi> Acts 8.38, 39. <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in <hi>Water</hi> holdeth forth in a likeneſs, a <hi>buriall</hi> with <hi>Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. All which declareth, that Baptiſme, is Dipping the whole perſon in Water, and this learned <hi>Perkins,</hi> freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffeſſeth in his <hi>Golden Chaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:170393:36"/>
               <p>Furthermore, penitent Men and Women are the only Subjects of Baptiſme, and not Infants.</p>
               <p>That ſuch as profeſſe faith as aforeſaid are to be Baptized, and not Infants, will appeare, becauſe the Lord commands his ſervants, to <hi>Go teach all Nations Baptizing them,</hi> that learn the Goſpel, ſo as to believe the ſame; but Infants cannot learn the Goſpel by teaching, (for they know neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil, Deut.</hi> 1.39.) Therefore it is not lawful to Baptize them.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt commands ſuch to be Baptized, as believe through teaching, or preaching, is evident, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. in theſe words. <hi>Go and teach all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> That is, Them of the Nations that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for they might not Baptize unbelieving Jewes, nor heathens; therefore <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, being the ſame with that of <hi>Matthew,</hi> That Chriſt commands the <hi>Goſpel to be preached to every creature, and <hi>He</hi> that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> ſo then the Goſpel is to be preached to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this end, that all may believe: but all do not, but they that hear ſo as to believe the Goſpel, are to be Baptized and no other are in the Commiſſion, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandenent of Chriſt for baptiſme it is plain; ſo then, they that Baptize Infants, do that which they have no Law of Chriſt for; nay,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170393:37"/>it is againſt the Law of Chriſt, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve through preaching, and ſo they have not faith, for there is but <hi>one faith,</hi> and that <hi>comes by hearing,</hi> Epheſ. 4.5. Rom. 10.14.17.</p>

               <p>Now if any queſtion how Infants dying in infancy, can be ſaved, becauſe they beleeve not? I ſay, that if you look back to what is ſaid as touching <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, you may ſee that all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying in Infancy ſhall be ſaved; for the ſon ſhall not die for the Iniquity of the Father, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin ſhall be taken off from all at the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But to return, there is no Commandment in all the Scriptures (which are the word of God) for the Baptiſme of Infants; and where there is <hi>no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. 4.15. therefore he that refuſeth to baptize Infants, breaks no Law; Therefore no man can juſtly charge him with ſin, for a commandment gives ground to duty; and examples are teaching to ſhew us how duties ſhould be done; alſo note, that there is no example for infants Baptiſme in all the Scripture; (and yet they are able to make us <hi>wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15.) for the Apoſtles and ſervants of the Lord did Baptiſe ſuch only as did profeſs faith, and did gladly receive the word of the Goſpel, ſearch and ſee, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome ſay, <hi>That there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor Example for Women receiving the Lords Supper, yet they are to receive it; ſo may Infants be Baptized, though no Command nor Example for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:170393:38"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this objection it is granted, that there is no command, nor example for Infants Baptiſme: alſo note, that beleeving baptiſed women are diſciples, and are members of the Church of Chriſt, and ſo are commanded to break bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25, 28. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the 1 of <hi>Act.</hi> 14. with the 2 of <hi>Acts.</hi> 41, 42. you may ſee that women did receive the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>But if any ſhould ſay, That Infants are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and therefore are to be baptized. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That Chriſt faith, that <hi>whoſoever beareth not his croſs, and followeth not after him, cannot be his diſciple,</hi> Luke 14.27. but Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do ſo, therefore they cannot be his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more to this Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt at this place, becauſe many have wrote very largely upon it, and there is no true conſequence to be gathered from all the Scriptures for Infants Baptiſme, for it is againſt Scripture, and croſſeth the way of the New Teſtament, for it brings into the Church a fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed, inſtead of a Spiritual: and ſo makes void the command of God as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing it is ſo, that penitent, beleeving men and women, are only to be Baptized, let all the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170393:39"/>Churches in the fear of God, take heed that they Baptize no other but ſuch as are truly penitent, beleeving men and women, that ſo all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chriſt, may be new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, living ſtones taught of God, built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf being the Cheif corner ſtone, that all the building may be fitly framed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, growing unto an holy Temple in the Lord, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>There is alſo the Baptiſme of the Spirit, which is a powerful falling down of the ſpirit, ſo as to be filled with it, enabling men to do ſome great work, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. But this Baptiſme of the Spirit is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo comparatively, as Chriſt is called a door, <hi>John</hi> 10.7. but there is but one Baptiſme really, and that is in water, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>The next Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, is <hi>Prayer,</hi> with <hi>Laying on of hands;</hi> for the gift of the ſpirit; ſo as to abide with us, and to lead us into all truth, and bring all things ſeaſonably to remembrance, and comfort us in all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>Ch.</hi> 16.13. note, it is the gift of the ſpirit, that is to be prayed for, not gifts, but the ſpirit as a gift, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and ſo gifts follow, as it pleaſeth the holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſo they that practice Laying
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170393:39"/>on of hands, with prayer, ſhew that they do look upon Chriſt as the only Prophet, to teach them by his ſpirit according to his word, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Now this of Laying on of Hands, was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon all Beleevers Baptized; for the Church of <hi>Samaria,</hi> were under it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 15, 17. And the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were under it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.6. and the Church of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. therefore all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for they all walked in one way and order, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But there is no Command for Laying on of Hands; therefore it ought not to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a Command from Chriſt for it, for the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith, it is a Principle of the Teaching or Doctrine of Chriſt, and ſo commanded by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But this Laying on of Hands ſpoken off,</hi> Heb. 6. <hi>is not that Laying on of Hands which followeth Beleevers Baptiſme, or it is doubtful whether it be that or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, underſtand that there was but three ſorts of Laying on of Hands, practiſed by the Apoſtles, and they are theſe; Laying on of Hands to recover the Sick; and upon Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and upon perſons Baptized; Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, the Laying on Hands upon the Sick, for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170393:40"/>men might be ſick, and recovered through Laying on of Hands, and sick again, and ſo reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again, and again, and ſo ſome men might be under this Laying on of Hands many times; but this in <hi>Heb.</hi> the 6. muſt not be practiſed above once, for it is ſaid, <hi>Not laying again, the foundation of repentance from dead works, of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, and Laying on of Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, it cannot be that Laying on of Hands on Officers, for it is ſaid, that they that had laid this Laying on of Hauds ſpoken off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>had need to be taught the firſt Principles of the Word of God:</hi> but Officers could not be ſo ignorant, therefore it was not upon Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſame that are exhorted to go on to perfection, had laid this Laying on of Hands, as you may ſee, if you read diligently the 1, and 2, verſes; Now all are exhorted to go on to perfection; therefore all the Church of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> were under this Laying on of Hands; ſo then it cannot be, that upon the Sick, nor that upon Officers; for men may go on to perfection, and never be under that Laying on of Hands for the Sick, nor yet that upon Officers; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Laying on of Hands ſpoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. is that only which followeth Baptiſme; and to this agreeth the order of words, verſ. 2. neither
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170393:40"/>can it be thought on good grounds, that the holy ſpirit ſhould rank any other Laying on of hands with theſe Principles, which are the beginning of a Chriſtian man; ſo then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that Prayer with Laying on of Hands, upon every Baptized perſon, is a Principle of the Doctrine, or beginning word of Chriſt, as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the end of Laying on of hands was, that the ſpirit might be given, ſo, as that ſome extraordinary gifts might follow, as there did,</hi> Acts 19. <hi>but we ſee none now; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be practiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the ſame reaſon we may refuſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for the Apoſtles promiſes the gift of the ſpirit to every penitent, believing, baptized perſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. which then did fall down miraculouſly; but we ſee it not ſo now; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Baptiſme,</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith that <hi>theſe ſignes ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them that believe the Goſpel; in the name of the Lord Jeſus they ſhould caſt out devils, &amp; ſhall ſpeak with new tongues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. But we ſee no man do any ſuch thing now; Therefore by the ſame ground, you may ſay no man believeth; and then no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Again, the Apoſtle ſaith, God hath <hi>ſet</hi> in the <hi>Church, miracle-workers,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. By the ſame rule no miracles, no
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170393:41"/>Church; but miſtake not, the Goſpel &amp; the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof, and the whole way thereof was at the firſt confirmed by ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. and all Believers are to walk up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, and all the Ordinances, and the whole way thereof, untill Chriſt come, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit of the Lord is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſo as to be given to all penitent, belieev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, baptized perſons, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. and the way and order of the Goſpel is, to ſeek it by Prayer, and Laying on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>The next Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, is the <hi>Reſurriction of the dead;</hi> which is this, to believe that Chriſts very body that was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did riſe from the dead the third day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 20. and that our bodies ſhall alſo riſe again from the grave, when Chriſt cometh in perſon again, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>The Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, &amp; with the trump of God; and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which are alive and remains, ſhall be caught up together with them, in the cloud, to meet the Lord in the aire, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:170393:41"/>
               <p>Now it is very plain, that the very body of Chriſt which was crucified, and buried, did riſe again, he and not a ſpirit like that body, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe he commandeth his Diſciples to <hi>handle him, and ſee,</hi> for a ſpirit hath not <hi>fleſh and bones,</hi> as I have; and ſo he ſhewed them <hi>his hands</hi> and <hi>his feet, Luke</hi> 24 39.40. and ſo he ſhewed <hi>Thomas</hi> the place of the <hi>nailes,</hi> bidding him, <hi>put his hand into his ſide;</hi> all making it appeare, that it was the very body that was nailed to the Croſſe, and peirced with a ſpear, that did riſe again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe he did <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> with his Diſciples, after he aroſe from the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.40, 41. and was ſhewed openly ſeveral times, not only to the <hi>eleven Apoſtles,</hi> but to <hi>five hundred brethren at once,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.6.</p>
               <p>So then, ſeeing Chriſts body is riſen from the dead, ſo ſhall all mens bodies, the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt alſo, ſhall be raiſed from the grave at the laſt day, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, that the bodies of the righteous ſhall riſe from the grave according to that in the 26 of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my dead body ſhall they ariſe, awake and ſing, yee that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of hearbs, and the earth ſhall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170393:42"/>caſt out the dead,</hi> yea if the <hi>righteous in Chriſt have hope in this life only, they were of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. Becauſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and temptation and trialls, according to <hi>John</hi> 16.33. Chriſt tells the righteous, that <hi>in him they ſhall have peace, but in the world they ſhall have tribulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, they ſhall riſe again to receive a reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. or elſe it were better for them to eat and drink, for to morrow they ſhall die; yea, it cannot ſtand with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, that his ſhould ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perſecution alwaies here on their bodies, for the teſtifying of truth, and their bodies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to riſe to be freed from miſery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body;</hi> and ſo he ſaith, <hi>That corruptible, muſt put on incorruption;</hi> ſo I reaſon, That is it the ſame body that died, that ſhall be raiſed, only it ſhall be changed into a ſpiritual body; for there is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, but it is that <hi>Same</hi> that is natural, that ſhall be made ſpiritual at the Reſurrection; Therefore note what the Apoſtle ſaith I pray, and that is this, <hi>
                     <hi>It</hi> is ſown a natural body, <hi>It</hi> is raiſed a ſpiritual body;</hi> ſo it is, that every ſeed according to the compariſon, that the Apoſtle makes of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170393:42"/>ſeed hath his own body, and ſo the compariſon of the ſeed, doth lively ſet it forth, for the corn doth not bring forth <hi>except</hi> it die, that is, be changed, for ſo the word die, holds it forth; ſo the natural body cannot be made a ſpiritual body <hi>except</hi> it die, or be changed, and ſo God giveth it another body as it pleaſeth him, for he maketh that natural body, a ſpiritual body, and ſo it puts on immortality at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on day, and ſo the ſame fleſh and blood, as it is a corruptible body, cannot inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God;</hi> but that corruptible body of fleſh, ſhall be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible body of fleſh, for it ſhall be fleſh and bones after the Reſurrection, for Chriſts body was ſo, after he was riſen, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. So then it is the ſame body that dyeth, that ſhall be raiſed, only it ſhall be made incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in all perfection, for this <hi>corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal, muſt put on immortality,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. So it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye, nor go down to death any more, and therefore when it riſeth from the grave, or the dead, it triumpheth over death and the grave, as it appeareth at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. to 57. And to this agreeth very ſweetly that in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170393:43"/>death; O death I will be thy death, O grave, I will be thy deſtruction; repentance ſhall be hid from mine eyes;</hi> God is not as man that he ſhould repent, he will make good his promiſe, his name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> making good his promiſes; note alſo I pray, that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8. <hi>He will ſwallow up death in victory, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of his people ſhall he take away from all the earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly regeneration, or the knowledge of God in the higheſt degree that can be attained on this ſide the grave, is no where in Scripture called a Reſurrection, therefore I conclude, that that is no Reſurrection; and that this is good reaſoning, it appeareth plainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. and if we note the Scripture, we may ſee this only is a reſurrection, which is the riſing from the grave, or from the dead, after the breath is departed, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that he ſhall <hi>See God in his fleſh,</hi> and them <hi>very eyes, and no other ſhall behold him,</hi> for him, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26. Note, that he ſaith, he ſhall ſee God in his fleſh, which ſheweth, that the ſame fleſh ſhall riſe again, and be made incorrupti ble, yea, immortall, and then ſhall ſee God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to face, yea in his glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the dead ſhall riſe at the comming of Chriſt, is ſhewn by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples we read of in the Scriptures, how the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170393:43"/>dead were raiſed, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 17. <hi>Elijah</hi> raiſed the widdowes Son, and in 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 4. <hi>Eliſha</hi> raiſed the <hi>Shunamites</hi> child from the dead; and chap. 32.21. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.52, 53. <hi>The graves were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bodies of the Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and went into the holy city &amp; appeared unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> note, the bodies of the Saints aroſe, therefore the bodies of the children of God ſhall rife from the dead, and ſo the Lord Jeſus raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> his body from the grave, when he had been dead four dayes, <hi>Jo.</hi> 11.39, 44. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.37, 41. <hi>Peter</hi> raiſed <hi>Tabitha,</hi> ſo then the dead were raiſed in the time of the law, and by Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the glory of God; which teacheth us, that it is not a thing incredible that God ſhould raiſe again the dead, yea, ſeeing Chriſt the firſt fruits is raiſed, afterward they that are Chriſts at his coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt proves the reſurrection by that which was written by <hi>Moſes</hi> after <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was dead, that God was a God to them though they were dead, yet God is not a God to the dead, but to the living; for all live unto him; therefore <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt riſe again, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38. &amp; ſo many ſhall come from the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, and ſit down with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the kingdome of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.28, 29.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170393:44"/>ſo if the Scriptures be true, the dead muſt riſe, but heaven and earth muſt paſs away, but not one jot or tittle of his word ſhall not faile, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Ch.</hi> 24.39. Therefore the reſurrection is certaine, and a bleſſed truth.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that the juſt and unjuſt ſhall riſe from the dead, is plain, in that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> the 5.28, 29. <hi>Marvaile not at this, for the hour ſhall come, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voyce, and they ſhall come forth that have done good unto the reſurrection of life, but they that have done evil, unto the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of condemnation;</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the great Article of his faith, when he was accuſed of the Jewes, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. freely confeſſing unto the Governour, <hi>that after the way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhiped he the God of his Fathers, beleeving all things which are witten in the law and the Prophets,</hi> and had <hi>hope towards God, that the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> (which they themſelves look for alſo) <hi>ſhall be both of juſt and unjuſt;</hi> and ſo I conclude the juſt mans body ſhall be raiſed from the grave, or be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the unjuſt alſo.</p>
               <p>The next Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt is, the Eternal Judgment, and that is this; <hi>That every man ſhall be judged according to his works done in the fleſh, be they good, or evil, Math.</hi> 16.27. <hi>for the Son of man ſhall come in the glory of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170393:44"/>his Father, with his Angels, and then ſhall he give to every man according to his deeds, Mat.</hi> 25.31, 32. <hi>When the Son of man cometh in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him; then ſhall he ſit upon the Throne of his glory; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeperate them one from another, as a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſeperateth the Sheep from the Goats; For we muſt all appear before the judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every man may receive the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether they be good, or evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Saints muſt give an account of all that they have done at the day of Judgment, after they are raiſed from the dead, (or changed being made immortal) <hi>For God will bring every work unto judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or evil, Eccl.</hi> 12.14. And to this Chriſt ſpeaks very fully, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.26. <hi>That of every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak they ſhall give account at the day of judgment; For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned;</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We ſhall all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 14.10. ſo that God ſhall judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. but Saints ſins ſhall not be mentioned ſo as to condemnation, but ſhall be blotted out at that good day, that day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing,

               <p>Theſe Principles or foundations Peices, or Pillars upon which wiſdome builds her houſe, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1.) are the Doctrine or commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, and are laid down upon Jeſus Chriſt the cheife Corner ſtone, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20 <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:170393:47"/>
               <p>And there is no man or woman that can be judged, or lookt upon as a Chriſtian in order according to the Scriptures, nor to be received into communion with the Church, except he beleeve and practiſe this Doctrine; miſtake me not, there may be ſome, that walk up to their light, and neglect not to know more, that may be precious in the ſight of God; but we are to look to the order of the new Teſtament, and to walk accordingly, doing all things decently and in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Therefore no man ought to be received into communion in a Church ſtate, but thoſe that do own and practiſe all the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p>And that this ought to be ſo; firſt conſider, that all that began to be Chriſtians, owned all this beginning Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. and therefore they are called the firſt <hi>Principles of the Word of God, and milk for Babes,</hi> Heb. 5.12, 13. or, the <hi>word of the beginning of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo the beginning of a Chriſtian man; and the <hi>three thouſand which gladly received the word were baptiſed, Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. that is dipped in water; <hi>and continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine,</hi> which is the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As they under the Law of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were to walk up in all the Law, which did hold out Chriſt to come in the fleſh, doing all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170393:47"/>the commandements, as the Lord commanded them in order, ſo were accounted righteous, and in order according to the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12, 13. So even ſo, all they that, and will prove themſelves viſible Chriſtians in order, ſince the Reſurrection of Chriſt, muſt walk up in the Doctrine, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning word of Chriſt, and in all his Ordinances which declare Chriſt come in the fleſh; <hi>John</hi> 1.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.23. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to give more heed to the word of Chriſt (ſo as to keep his Statutes wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in order according to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.3, 4.) then the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to the Law; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> was like to be ſlaine becauſe he had not circumciſed his ſon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24, 25. and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> was ſlaine for touching the Arke, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 13.9, 10. becauſe they carried it not in due order, <hi>Ch.</hi> 15.12, 13. and the Lord ſharply reproveth the Jewes, for receiving into his houſe uncircumciſed in heart, and uncircumciſed in fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7, 9. So then it is plain, that no uncircumciſed perſon was to be received into communion under the Law, nor none of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could ſtand before God with acceptance, but they that walked up according to the Law; and we are to give more diligent heed to Chriſt, then they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170393:48"/>unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> therefore the Church of Chriſt ought to receive none into communion, but ſuch as beleeve and practiſe all the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, profeſſing from the heart o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to that forme of Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. and they only are to abide in communion, that walk up in all the Commandements of the Lord orderly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Church of the <hi>Teſſalonians</hi> is commanded in the name of the Lord Jeſus, to <hi>withdraw from every brother that walks diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and not after the inſtructions received of the Apoſtles,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.6. Now if they were to be caſt out of the Church that walk not after the inſtructions of the Apoſtles, it followeth, that they are not to be received into the Church, that never came up to the beginning of a Chriſtian man, ſo as to own all the Principles of the Doctrine, or beginning word of Chriſt, for that were to build again the things we have deſtroyed, and ſo to make our ſelves tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.18.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But there are ſome in the Nations which holds Infants Baptiſme, and ſubmit not to the order of the Doctrine of Chriſt, yet are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the ſight of God, and have communion with him; therefore may have communion with the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant that ſome in of the Nation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170393:48"/>may fear God, and have acceptance with him; yet it doth not follow that they may be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, for the Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> had acceptance with God, yet had not communion with the Jewes, neither did Chriſt account her to be a child of the old Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.26, 27, 28. and <hi>Cornelius</hi> prayers heard, and yet not received into communion with the Jewes, nor with the Church of Chriſt, untill he was Baptiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.6, 47. and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Teſtament it was not enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the circumciſion of the heart, but they muſt be circumciſed in the fleſh alſo, or no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is ſhewed before, and you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24, 25, 26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7. <hi>Gen</hi> 17.14. So even ſo, none but ſuch as profeſs faith in Chriſt, and are baptiſed into Chriſt, and ſo put on Chriſt, ſo made Diſciples according to the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4, 1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. are to be received into the Church of Chriſt. Further, for the proof of this, note what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Mark them which cauſe diviſions, and offences, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Doctrine that ye have learned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them:</hi> And the Apoſtles ſerperated the Diſciples from all others, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. Note al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4, 5. And we are commanded to ſeperate, and to touch no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. now to bring into the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170393:49"/>Church, believers ſeed in infancy, by baptiſing them, is to know them after the fleſh, and ſo to touch an unclean thing; and ſo they that do it, are tranſgreſſours, yea very much croſſe the plain way of the new Covenant in changing the Ordinance of Chriſt, to a falſe Subject, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 17. <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.5. So then it is plain from the old and new Teſtament, that to profeſſe holineſs in converſation, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſo as to admit men into the Church of Chriſt; but there muſt be alſo obedience in order to the form of the Doctrine, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning word of Chriſt; ſo worſhiping God, in ſpirit and in truth, according to the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>John</hi> 4.24. ſo they are to be received into the Church of Chriſt, and no otherwiſe; therefore let every man mark well, and behold with his eyes, and hear with his ears, what is ſaid unto him concerning all the <hi>Ordinances of the houſe of the Lord, and all the lawes thereof,</hi> and mark well the <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the houſe, with every going forth of the ſanctuary,</hi> Ezek. 44.5.</p>
               <p>Furthermore mind alſo; that though the Apoſtles did bear with the Churches in ſeverall things of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (becauſe they were once commanded of God, and they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious to them, not being truly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet they did not receive into the Church,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170393:49"/>nor bear with them that did not obey Chriſt in his Ordinances, ſo as to walk up after the new Covenant, as it hath been ſhewed, and this further appeareth in many places of Scripture, take ſome for many, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>Object. But ſome men may ſay, <hi>I contend more for Baptiſme, then for other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I ſay, the Lord knowes I do not, but I do with a good conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for thoſe Ordinances, that men have made void by their tradition, of which Baptiſme is one, for there is one Baptiſme <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. which is Believers only, for ſprinkling of Infants, or Baptizing them, is not the Ordinance of Chriſt, nor is no more accepted with God, then offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lamb, or any thing under the Law that had a blemiſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.20, 25. But for Believers Baptiſme, it was as much honoured as any Ordinance, for Jeſus himſelf being about <hi>thirty years of age was Baptized, &amp; the ſpirit of God deſcending like a dove, lighting upon him; There came a voice from heaven ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.16, 17. Luke 3.23. Father, Son, and Spirit in a ſingular ſence met at Baptiſme, and ſo Chriſt was in a moſt excellent way viſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly declared to be the Son of God; and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170393:50"/>Believer in a ſingular ſence at his Baptiſm, is viſibly declared to be the Child of God.</p>
               <p>Object. But ſome men have ſaid, <hi>that we are not to practice this Doctrine becauſe the Author to the</hi> Hebrewes <hi>ſayes,</hi> not laying again theſe principles, but be led forward to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>And the Epiſtles and commandements in the Scriptures, were for that age, and for the people that lived in the Apoſtles dayes, for the Epiſtles were written to ſeveral Churches; we being not thoſe Churches, they do not concern us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> exhorts them to their duty, and ſo all believers, to go on to perfection in the way of Chriſt, taking up the ſimilitude of a building to make it out; and as in the building of an houſe there are Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Principle peices laid down, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of theſe Foundations, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Peices, the builders of a Temporall houſe go up as farre as the Principles guid them, and then the houſe is come to perfection, or finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo even ſo, in this ſpirituall houſe, when we at the firſt have laid down theſe Principles, we are to go up to perfection, according to the rule of the Foundation Peices in the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt being the cheife Corner Stone, on which the building fitly framed together, groweth up unto an holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord, Eph.</hi> 2.21. And when we are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170393:50"/>come as high as theſe Principles lead us, we are come to perfection; for when we injoy the Reſurrection, and the eternal Judgement, we are then come to perfection; and as in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral houſe, none can finiſh it, ſo as to make it perfect, if they do not build according to the rule of the Principles or Foundation Peices laid down; ſo alſo in the ſpiritual houſe, if we go not up according to the rule of the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how can we go up to perfection. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in a temporal houſe, if they leave out any of the Foundation Peices, they cannot build up to perfection; then how can any in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al building, go up to perfection, if they leave out any of the Principles, for if they do, the houſe will be in danger to fall. Again, in a temporal building, when they have laid down the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe, if they build not upon them, but lye ſtill, there can be no perfection, and ſo it is in the ſpiritual houſe alſo; and that was that which, the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> blames them for, their neglect in not going forward in the building of the ſpiritual houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he have them to lay the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again, but to go forward to perfection, as they teach them for to do, <hi>for no other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt; and whoſoever heares his word, and doth the ſame, builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170393:51"/>on him, the rock of ages, Mat.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. And alſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written for this end, to teach all men their duties in all ages till Chriſt come, and yet many times, the words thereof ſpoken to the People in preſent being, yet concerns all; as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Lord ſaies to <hi>Eve,</hi> that ſhe ſhould <hi>bring forth in ſorrow, Gen.</hi> 3.16. the word is ſpoken to her only, yet all women bring forth in ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſpeakes to his diſciples which were then preſent with him at that time, that when the <hi>ſignes did appeare,</hi> which he had declared concerning his <hi>coming,</hi> they ſhould <hi>lift up their heads, for their redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neer, Luke</hi> 21.28. Now theſe words though ſpoken to the preſent Diſciples, are for the comfort of them eſpecially that live a little before the coming of Chriſt; therefore the Scriptures are for to teach us upon whom the ends of the world are come, yea, even them that live when the laſt ſignes of Chriſts coming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the Lord Jeſus exhorts the ſaints of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to <hi>hold faſt that burden that he laid upon them untill he come, Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his ſecond Epiſtle, for to warn the ſaints to give diligent heed to the words of the Prophets, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord Jeſus, delivered by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170393:51"/>the Apoſtle, for ſaith be, <hi>in the laſt dayes there ſhall come ſcoffers walking after their own luſts; ſaying, where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> and he wrote this when his departing was at hand, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.14. And <hi>Jude</hi> bids the ſaints <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints,</hi> Jude 3. and <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that he <hi>that remaineth in him, ought even ſo to walk as he hath walked,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. So it is evident, that whoſoever is in Chirſt ought to walk after him according to his word in all ages, and that he wrote no <hi>new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> and that the <hi>old Commandement is the word, which they have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> verſ. 7. So that it is evident, that in the Scriptures are all the commandements of God, for all the children of men to walk up in till Chriſt come in perſon, who is the bright morning ſtar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. for there is <hi>no other Goſpel then that which hath been preached,</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9. <hi>So Jeſus Chriſt, yeſterday, to day and the ſame for ever;</hi> therefore, <hi>be not carryed about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines, for it is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace,</hi> Heb. 13.8, 9. ſo I ſay with <hi>Paul</hi> (who wrote to <hi>Timothy</hi> a little before his death) that the <hi>Sciptures are able, to make a man (wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, for all Scripture is given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170393:52"/>ſpiration of God, and is proſitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, thorowly furniſhed unto all good workes,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But there is no walking up in theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, becauſe we cannot ſee any ſo ſent of God to preach &amp; work miracles as the Apoſtles did; &amp; ſo there is no Adminſtrator of Ordinances, for we do no ſee the ſigns following ſpoken of,</hi> Mark 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Lord Jeſus doth give all power to thoſe that do believe, that he is the Chriſt, the Son of the living God, and have through grace willing hearts to obey him, to preach and to adminiſter all Ordinances, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22. Yea they are the Church that do believe he is the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> them, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> to make <hi>interceſſion by his bloud, ſpeaking better things then that of</hi> Abell, and the alone <hi>Prophet,</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> them, they <hi>hearing</hi> him in <hi>all things, Mat.</hi> 17.5. ſo as to have <hi>fellowſhip, in breaking of bread, and prayer,</hi> Acts 3.22, 23. I ſay and witneſs with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they which believe with all their hearts, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and have willing hearts to obey as aforeſaid, may preach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter all Ordinances, orderly, and ſo become a Church, although they do not work Miracles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Teſtament is bound up, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170393:52"/>law ſealed among Diſciples, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.16. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ordinances alſo, they that <hi>continue in the word of Chriſt, are his Diſciples indeed, and they are the friends of Chriſt that do whatſoever he commands them, John</hi> 1.14, 31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.14. Now if they have not power to do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they cannot continue in his word, and ſo no Diſciples, nor friends; and ſo being not found in the old way, no reſt for their ſoules: but the Lord God would have all men obey him and have reſpect to all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Lord Jeſus is the Author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. Therefore he gives them that do believe, power to walk up in all his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They that do repent, &amp; believe, &amp; are ready to do all that the Lord commands by his Son (who ſpeaks in theſe laſt times to all men) and ſo hearing the voice of Chriſt, are his ſheep, <hi>Act</hi> 10.33. <hi>John</hi> 10. from the 4. to the 17. &amp; ſo have Chriſt, which is the ſubſtance, in whom all the promiſes are yea, and amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. therefore the adminſtration of Ordinances, and all is theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>John</hi> the dipper did no miracle, yet all that he ſpake was true, <hi>John</hi> 10 41. and therefore the Phariſees and Lawyers reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the counſel of God againſt themſelves, being not baptiſed of him; ſo it is plain that it was a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170393:53"/>very great evil in any to refuſe his Baptiſme, though he wrought no miracle; ſo even ſo, they that preach the truth according to the word, are not to be rejected, but received, though they work no miracle, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeaking to us is as much, if not more, as if a voyce from heaven ſpoke to us, as it appears, if you mind what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. which ſheweth, that they heard a voyce from heaven, declaring <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Son of God; and yet that we have a more ſure word of the Prophets, to the which we ſhall do well, if we take heed; yea, we are to mind and keep the commandments of the Apoſtles of the Lord and Saviour, even unto the laſt dayes, when there ſhall be mockers, which will walk after their luſts, and ſay, <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> and ſo forth, <hi>Chap</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. From all which it is clear and plain, that the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpeaking in the Scriptures the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, are to be abeyed, as if a voyce from heaven ſpoke to us, and if we do not, we ſin very greivouſly, though their be no miracles, for the Apoſtles writing the commandments of the Lord, it gives us ſufficient authority for to adminiſter Ordinances as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Moſes</hi> Law being written, they that returned from the captivity of Babylon walked up in it, though there was no miracle, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.63.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170393:53"/>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.14. No not any Preiſt that ſtood up with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they extraordinary Prophets, for they had not <hi>Haggai,</hi> nor <hi>Zechariah</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build the Temple, as it appeareth in the 4 of <hi>Ezra,</hi> compared with the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. and <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.1. So then the law written by <hi>Moſes</hi> gave full authority, he being but a ſervant, <hi>Muth more Thriſts Law being written, he being a Son;</hi> and heire of all things, we being heirs with him, as we walk up after the new Covenant, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Beleevers in Chriſt, holding out the Doctrine of Chriſt, have all power to preach, and to adminiſter Ordinances, yea, they only are ſent of Chriſt, for <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> 9.10. That he that <hi>bringeth not the Doctrine of Chriſt, ought not be received into the houſe,</hi> as a teacher, ſent of God, and that he that <hi>abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God;</hi> and ſo he directech the elect <hi>Lady,</hi> and her Children, how they ſhall know who are ſent of God, and they were ſuch as did bring the Doctrine of Chriſt, and that they which did not, or do not bring the Doctrine of Chriſt, are not ſent of God; ſo then it is not miracles alone that doth prove men to be ſent of God, but the Doctrine they bring proves it, it is not miracles proves it,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170393:54"/>for Antichriſt ſhall work miracles, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.14. So then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that they which bring the Doctrine of Chriſt, are ſent by Chriſt, ſo as to preach, and to adminiſter the Ordinances of Chriſt, whether they work Miracles or no, they preaching the truth, their Doctrine is to be received; for the <hi>Samaritans</hi> beleeved, when the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> declared Chriſt to them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.39. and Jeſus upbraided his Diſciples for their unbeleif, when they beleeved not them that declared him riſen from the dead, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14. And <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyceth that Chriſt was preached, though out of envy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 18. And the Scriptures are written, that men might beleeve, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.31. So men beleeving as it is written, they ſpeak, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>(For no man lighteth a candle and putteth it under a buſhel, but on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick;)</hi> ſo turning men to righteouſneſs, they ſhall ſhine as the ſtarrs for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. If any ſhould ſay, the Scriptures are not the word of the Lord; J ſay, that I need not to bring arguments to prove it to be the word of the Lord, for the Propheſies that foretel things to come therein, God will bring to paſs, ſo as men may be convinced of the truth of it.</p>
               <p>So having ſhewed you the matter of a Church, and what a Church or congregation of Chriſt is, as namely, ſuch as walk up in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170393:54"/>or Commandments of Chriſt, in ſingleneſs of heart, in fellowſhip, in breaking of bread, &amp; in prayers, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. And that none ought to have communion in breaking of Bread, but ſuch as own every Principle in the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the next Ordinance of Chriſt is <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread;</hi> Now the manner of Breaking Bread, is firſt to take Bread, and to bleſs it in the name of the Lord, and then to break it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Wine in the next place, and bleſs it alſo; and then the Congregation are to divide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, eating and drinking of it moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Supper at even, or about the even, having communion together, diſcerning the Lords body, for the time we are not to bind it down to an hour, but it is to anſwer as unto a ſupper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We are to bleſs the Wine before we eat the Bread, in my underſtanding, becauſe the Bread being bleſſed diſtinct apart from the Cup, before we eate up the Bread, ſets out Chriſts Body broken and his Blood ſhed before our eyes in the ſign; but if we eat up the Bread before we bleſs the Cup, then we eat up the Body of Chriſt in the ſign, before we have the Cup, or Blood in the ſign; for it is not the Cup of the new Teſtament, untill it is bleſſed, for it is ſanctified by the word of God, and ſet apart by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170393:55"/>Prayer; yea, if we eat up the Bread before we bleſſe the Cup, we divide Chriſt, in our feeding upon the Bread, before we have the Cup; therefore we ought to bleſſe the Bread, and break it, and then bleſſe the Cup, and then eat and drink of it, eying Chriſt as his Body being broken, and his Bloud being ſhed for our ſins; alſo take notice, that the order of words doth not prove, that the Bread muſt be eaten, before the Cup is bleſſed, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Cup firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, that when Chriſt had <hi>bleſſed the cup, he gave it to them,</hi> and they all drank of it, before he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that Chriſt declared what it ſignified, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.23, 24. But it doth not follow in reaſon, that they did drink all of it, before he gave them to underſtand what the Wine (being ſet apart) ſignified; ſo it doth not follow, though Chriſt did bleſſe the Bread, and gave it to his Diſciples, and bid them eat, that they did eat, before he bleſt the Cup; but rather the Bread being bleſſed, be bleſſed the Cup alſo, that they might eat of that Breád, and drink of that Cup, diſcerning the Lords Body broken, and his Bloud ſhed for remiſſion of ſins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 28.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it ought to be a Supper with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, becauſe it is ſaid to be a <hi>Supper,</hi> and a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>Ch.</hi> 11.20. and there
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170393:55"/>is nothing in all the Scripture, that is ſaid to be a Supper, if there be any eating at all, that is leſſe then an eating to ſatisfaction with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is perfect ſatisfaction in Jeſus the Saviour; therefore to eat to refreſhment is the more lively and full.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But it was not a Supper when Chriſt ſet it apart, for it was eaten after the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord took them off from eating the Paſsover before they had done, for the Scripture ſaith; <hi>As they were eating, he took bread and brake it,</hi> and ſo the Paſchal Lamb, and the Bread and Wine together made their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for the two ſignes, the Paſchal Lamb, and the Bread and Wine, one holding out Chriſt to be ſlain, the other, Chriſt as ſlain meet; Chriſt the ſubſtance being there; but when Chriſt was ſlain, the Paſsover was aboliſhed, no more to be kept; the Ordinance of Bread and Wine, which is called the Lords Supper, only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is to be a Supper, as aforeſaid; for ſo it holdeth out the ſubſtance Jeſus excellently; but let every man eat ſo much of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, as it may be moſt helpful unto him, to diſcern the Lords Body broken, and his Bloud ſhed for his ſins, and the benefits that come, and ſhall come thereby; but let every
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170393:56"/>man take heed in the fear of God, that they do not eat and drink too much, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, better it would be for to eat, and drink too little.</p>
               <p>Alſo mind, That there is only Bread and Wine to be eaten at the Lords Supper, and no feaſt of other food, for that which Chriſt and his Diſciples did eat before the Bread and Wine, was the Paſsover Lamb, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.18, 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.12, 16. <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.13, 15. and <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention only of Bread and Wine, in the 10. and 11. of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> and for the love feaſt that ſome talk of to be kept before they eat the Bread and drink the Wine, there is no ſuch thing written in the Scripture; but there is a feaſt of charity ſpoken of, <hi>Jude</hi> 12. which is that feaſt that Chriſt commands, to call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, let him that is able, do this ſingular thing, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> for the poor cannot recompence him, but he ſhall be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo mind well, That it is Bread and Wine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is bleſſed, not changed into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold, though it be ſaid, after it is bleſſed, <hi>This is my Body which was broken for you, and my Bloud which was ſhed for remiſſion of ſins;</hi> it is ſo ſaid, becauſe in a figure, or ſhaddow, it holdeth forth Chriſts
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170393:56"/>Body broken, and his Bloud ſhed for remiſſion of ſins; and ſo the Paſsover Lamb did hold out the Lords paſſing over the firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet is called the Lords Paſsover, it putting them in mind of the ſame, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.21, 27. and alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, it is Bread and Wine, after it is bleſſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28. therefore not the reall Body and Blood of Chriſt; <hi>So let a man examine himſelf,</hi> whether he diſcern the Lords Body offered up as a Sacrifice for ſin, to make an Attonement for him, and that he be in love and peace with all men; ſo that in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he may eat his Fleſh, and drink his Bloud, ſo as that there may be a communion in one body, Chriſt being the Head, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</p>
               <p>Moreover, for the better being of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Chriſt, the Lord Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and given Overſeers, and gifted men, and they are firſt Apoſtles, or Meſſengers, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors, and Teachers, for the Lord Jeſus did <hi>aſcend on high, and gave gifts unto men, for the gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Saints, for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for the edification of the body of Chriſt, till we all meet together in the unity of the faith, and knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, and unto the meaſure of the age of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170393:57"/>fulneſs of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28.</p>
               <p>And for the word Apoſtle, it being Engliſhed is Meſſenger, for ſo the word holdeth forth, and ſo it may be tranſlated, and is ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. they are to be choſen by the Congregation out of the Congregation, for ſo was <hi>Matthias</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.23, 24, 25, 26. And the Spirit commanded the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with the Prophets, to ſeparate <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and ſend them forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. And that was the will, and way of God, for after that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.4, 14. they are both called Apoſtles and not before; and ſo the Church are to chooſe Meſſengers ſtill, for the gathering the Church, and eſtabliſhing of the ſame; ſo that they are to go forth to preach the Goſpel, that all may know God in Chriſt, and own the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Alſo it appeareth, that Meſſengers or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, are to be in the Church till Chriſt comes, from that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12, 13. That in <hi>Rev.</hi> the 18. ſheweth, that there ſhall be Apoſtles to <hi>rejoyce</hi> at the <hi>overthrow</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Whore,</hi> and that will be a little before the coming of Chriſt; and that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. ſheweth, that they are for the <hi>gathering together of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edification of the Body
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170393:57"/>of Chriſt, till we all meet together in the unity of the faith, and knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, and untill the meaſure of the age of the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> Until the coming of Chriſt in perſon: Therefore Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are to be till Chriſt come.</p>
               <p>Again, If Paſtors and Teachers are to abide in the Church, then Meſſengers, or Apoſtles; but Paſtors and Teachers are to abide; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Meſſengers alſo; for the <hi>Lord aſcended up on high, and gave gifts to men, ſome to be Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers;</hi> one gift or office is to continue as long as the other, that is plain, if you note the Scripture, and that is till Chriſt cometh, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
               <p>Again, if you note the Scriptures you may ſee, that there were more Apoſtles then the twelve, for there was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which were ſet apart by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and others that were Meſſengers of the Churches, and the glory of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. If they were made Meſſengers only to carry the contribution of the Church, how can they be ſaid to be the glory of Chriſt? Let the wiſe judge; they were great Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel with <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> was left at <hi>Crete,</hi> to redreſs the things that remain, and to ordain Elders, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. Therefore they were not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170393:58"/>ſet apart to carry contribution only, (though they did it upon occaſion as <hi>Paul</hi> did) but for the work of the Miniſtry; and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was a Companion in labour, and fellow Souldier with <hi>Paul;</hi> and the Meſſenger of the Church of the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 2.25. and the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> tryed ſome, which ſaid they were Apoſtles, and found them liars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2. Therefore there were many Apoſtles beſides the twelve.</p>
               <p>Again, there is very much need (if not as much as ever) of Meſſengers to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to make out truth to the Nations in theſe laſt times; yea, the Goſpel is to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>every kindred, tongue and people;</hi> in theſe laſt times, <hi>for a witneſs unto all Nations, and then ſhall the end be, Matth.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. Therefore Meſſengers ought to be continued till Chriſt come; miſtake not, for I do not mean extraordinary Apoſtles as the twelve, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but ſuch as to perſwade men to what is written, ſo to believe and obey the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The way to chuſe, and ſet apart Meſſengers, Elders, and Deacons, it is by electing them out of their own company, I mean the Church is to chuſe them by a free conſent (as in part hath been ſhewed before) and by faſting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and laying on of hands on them; they are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170393:58"/>ſo to be ſet apart to their ſeveral offices, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.23, 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.23. where the word Election is left out in the new tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it is in the old, and cannot be denied to be in the Greek, the Elders, or Paſtors work is to feed the Flock of Chriſt, and to take care of the Church, and of every Member thereof, looking up the Sheep if they go aſtray, labouring in the work of the Miniſtry, giving in meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.45. being unto them that believe an enſample in word, in converſation, in love, in ſpirit, in zeal, in faith, and in pureneſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.12. Not as though they were <hi>Lords over Gods heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> feeding the Flock, not by <hi>conſtraint,</hi> but <hi>willingly,</hi> not for <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> but of a <hi>ready mind,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3. let them be very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and faithful men in their places, for curſed is he that doth the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</p>
               <p>The Deacons office is to look to the poor, and to ſerve them with all neceſſaries, the Church giving them ſufficient to do it, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. for qualifications of all the Officers; ſee the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The maintenance that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to have, is to be freely given them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. that is, all things neceſſary, that they may be enabled to do
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170393:59"/>the work of the Lord, and they alſo ought to endeavour to the uttermoſt, to make the Goſpel without charge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.34, 35. Their Maintenance ought not to be by Tythes, nor no forced Maintenance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the way of Chriſt is a way of love, no duty is available, but that which is done in love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Prieſthood being changed, therefore of neceſſity the Law, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.4.10.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Levites</hi> had no lot nor inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Deut.</hi> 14.27. and their work and labour of body was great about the Sacrifices, and taught the people alſo, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35, 11, 12, 13, 14. And therefore the Lord gave them Tythes, yet they were to give to the fatherleſs, and ſtranger, and widdow, a part of their Tithes; Therefore the Miniſters of the Goſpel being not <hi>Levites,</hi> neither have the Chriſtians a <hi>Canaan</hi> to divide by lot, for they are not twelve Tribes ſpringing from one man, neither are the Miniſters of the Goſpel the hundred part of the Nations, neither hath the Lord Jeſus given them Tithes; Therefore they that take Tithes wrong their own ſouls, in doing that which is unlawful.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They that take Tithes, or force it to be paid, deſtroy or make void the Law of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170393:59"/>Chriſt, which is a Law of love; for forced ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice cannot be in love; therefore the Miniſters of the Goſpel, have received a gift to preach, and <hi>freely received, freely give, Matth.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11. And Chriſtians truly knowing their duties, will freely give unto them of their goods, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. or ſet before them that they need, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, They that take Tithes bring in the ſervice of the Law, which is done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. and the Levitical Prieſthood which is changed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6, 12. and ſo deny Chriſt come in the fleſh; and forced maintenance, bringeth in compelled ſervice, which is abhorred by God, and good men; therefore Tithes, nor any forc'd Maintenance, is not the Maintenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, neither let any man ſay, that the Magiſtrate hath power to force men to pay Tithes, from that of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. and from that of <hi>Paul,</hi> that we are to pay <hi>cuſtome, to whom cuſtome belongs;</hi> I ſay, that in all civill things, we ought ſo to do, and rather then to offend, to pay upon a civil account, though it be not due as Chriſt did; but when it is required upon a ſpiritual account, as Tythes, or any forced maintenance for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, we may and ought to refuſe to pay, and the Magiſtrate ſins againſt God, if he force men to pay it; for the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170393:60"/>hath not, nor never had power to judge in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual caſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25, 26. for that is by the Lord given to the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18. and he, as a Member of the Church, hath power to judge, as every Member hath, and no more; but more of this in another place.</p>
               <p>Alſo, take notice of that Ordinance of Chriſt, of waſhing the Saints feet, it is commanded by Chriſt, and a bleſſing promiſed to them that do it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.14, 15, 16, 17. and therefore it ought to be done, and it ſetteth out Chriſts humility, and puts us in mind of the ſame; ſo declaring that the wayes of Chriſt are ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying wayes; and this is a ſelf-denying thing, and therefore ſerveth to humble the creature, and to beget familiarity, and love one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being done decently and in order.</p>
               <p>Alſo, as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is any among you afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him pray, is any merry, let him ſing, is any ſick among you, let him call for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church; and let them pray for him, and anoint him with oyl in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed ſin it ſhall be forgiven him; Acknowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed; for the prayer of a righteous man availeth much, if it be fervent,</hi> James 5.13, 14, 15, 16,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170393:60"/>17, 18. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.13. You may ſee there is faith required in the actors in this Ordinance, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and then the Lord will make good his promiſe; for he is faithful and cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Alſo Prayer with Faſting is a duty for the whole Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.33, 35. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. eſpecially for every Saint in private, entering into the Cloſet, or ſome ſecret place, that he be not ſeen of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5, 6, 16, 17, 18. Let every child of God be often in this duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5. he will profit very much thereby, they that neglect this duty, will not ſtand, or very hardly ſtand in theſe laſt times; the Lord put all his people upon this duty, that we may be able through grace to ſtand before the Son of Man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the way to deal with Members of the Church if they ſin againſt God, is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it be a private treſpaſs, he that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth is to be told of it, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. And if he repent he is to be forgiven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.3. for we ought to be like our heavenly Father, and if he hear not, he that is treſpaſſed againſt, is to call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with him, one or two more as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 16. But if he hear not, then tell it to the Church, and if he hear the Church, ſhe is alſo to forgive him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. but if he refuſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170393:61"/>to hear the Church, let him be unto the Church as a Heathen man, and a Publican; Alſo note, he that ſinneth privately is ſpeedily to be brought to the Church; the next Church meeting after he hath ſinned if poſſible.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe we are not to ſuffer ſin upon our brother, but plainly to rebuke him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe he may not pray, that doth not confeſs his ſin, and be reconciled to his Brother, for if he bring his gift to the <hi>Altar,</hi> Chriſt, and remember that his brother hath ought againſt him, let him not offer it, but firſt be reconciled to his Brother, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.23, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p>Further I ſay, he muſt be brought to the Church the next meeting, for elſe the Church will have communion with him that lieth in his ſin, and he will be in fault, that brings him not orderly to the Church.</p>
               <p>Alſo they that ſin openly, are to be rebuked before all, that others alſo may fear, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> blamed <hi>Peter</hi> before all men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 14. And he that is admoniſhed by the Church, and doth not hear the Church, is to be delivered to Satan, and ſo to withdraw from him; yea, not to have ſo much company as to eat common food; and ſo the Apoſtle exhorts and commandeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to deliver the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170393:61"/>Fornicator that had his Fathers wife; <hi>And if any man that is called a Brother, be a Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Covetous, or Idolater, or Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch a one eat not,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3, 10, 11. And ſo he commands the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in the name of the Lord Jeſus, to <hi>withdraw from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the inſtructions, which they received of him;</hi> and if any man obey not their ſayings, that they ſhould <hi>note him by</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and have <hi>no Company</hi> with him, that he <hi>may be aſhamed;</hi> yet count him not as an <hi>enemy,</hi> but <hi>admoniſh him</hi> as a <hi>Brother,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.6, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>So it is plain, that they that ſin, and will not hear the Church when they are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo as to confeſſe their ſin, and turn from it, yea, to make reſtitution if they be able, if they hear not, the Church is to deliver to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or to withdraw from him, or them, and then to admoniſh him two or three times ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and in the fear of God, not counting him as an enemy, but admoniſhing him as a brother, with all long ſuffering; and if he then neglect to hear the Church, ſhe is to reject him, and to let him be as a Heathen man, and a Publican; and a man being ſo rejected, or ſo cut off, I do not ſee how he can repent, yea, I am very much perſwaded, that he will never repent.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:170393:62"/>
               <p>I ſay, the Church muſt admoniſh two or three times, before ſhe do reject or cut off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ought to be like her heavenly father, merciful as he is meriful, and long ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Again, he that is an Heretick, ought to have the firſt, and ſecond admonition, before he is rejected; therefore all other ought to have two or three admonitions before any are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or cut off, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Alſo I ſay, that the man that is under dealing, being three times wiſely, and ſeriouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by the Church, and rejected; I do not ſee how he can repent: Firſt, becauſe whatſoever <hi>the Church binds on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever they looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven;</hi> now a man being once alive through believing, and then through ſin, become as a heathen and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, or as a dead man, and ſo bound, how can he live again, except a man twice dead may live again, <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No man cutteth a naturall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from a natural body, except it be rotten, and ſo endanger the whole body; even ſo alſo, in the ſpirituall body, the Church is to cut off them that will endanger the whole body, ſo as to carry them to hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.8, 9. So a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a natural body being cut off, cannot be ſet on again; ſo when a Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170393:62"/>or cut off a member, how can it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> had in execration, yea excommunicate to death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. or as ſome tranſlation reads it, that the meaning of the word may be this, <hi>let him be accurſſed even to the coming of the Lord;</hi> that is to ſay, to his deaths day, even for ever; now he that loves not the Lord, is he that keepeth not his commandments, or his ſayings, <hi>John</hi> 14.15, 23. and he that ſinneth, and will not hear the Church, being ſo often admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Lord hath appointed in his word, doth not keep the ſaying of Chriſt, and ſo loves not the Lord; therefore is to be rejected or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated unto death, till the Lord come; ſo according to that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. he that being <hi>often reproved, hardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed,</hi> and that without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Alſo mind well, that the power to judge dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and to deale with Members, lyeth in the Body, the Church, not in the Officers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct a part from the Church; This will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Lord commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. That the offender, and his offence, be brought to the Church, that they may judge
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170393:63"/>it; now the company of Elders are not the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. Therefore they have not the power apart from the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle writing to the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> commands them when they are gathered together in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver the Fornicatour (that had his fathers wife) to Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. to the 6. Mark, he doth not command the Elders to do it, but the Congregation, being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to do it; therefore the power lieth not in the Elders alone, but in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord Chriſt ſaith, that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exerciſe Lordſhip over them; and their great ones exerciſe authority upon them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you, <hi>but whoſoever will be great among you, ſhall be your ſervant, and whoſoever will be cheife of you, ſhall be ſervant of all, Mark</hi> 10.42, 43, 44. And therefore the Elders who are the cheife ſervants, are not to exerciſe Lordſhip over their Brethen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to rule without the Body, the Church, for if they ſhould rule without the Body, it would be like that evill that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake of, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.7. Servants upon horſes, and Princes walking as ſervants upon the earth; and ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170393:63"/>indeed it hath been, and is where the <hi>Pope,</hi> and Lord Biſhops, and Presbytery hath the power, they make the members of their National, Generational way, <hi>ſlaves</hi> to ſerve with great burdens, and many of them are very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>But although it be ſo, that the power lieth in every particular Body, the Church, to govern according to the word of Chriſt, yet underſtand that with conſent the Elders, and Meſſengers are to rule in love, and are to be obeyed, by every particular member, they exhorting and commanding duty, and declaring the ſence of the Church, according to the word of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. and alſo, the Body, the Church, may command the Elders, or Paſtours, and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, to look to their Miniſtry, which they have received in the Lord, that they fulfil it, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. And alſo note, it is good and ſafe for a particular Church, in things of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, to call for, or deſire help from ſiſter Churches, and ſo Meſſengers who are to take care of all Churches, in an eſpecial manner, are to go in ſuch caſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Hath not the Magiſtrates power in the Church, to ſet apart her Officers, and to puniſh Offenders as he ſeeth good, yea, with death if he pleaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for Chriſt hath not ſaid any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170393:64"/>where that he ſhould ſo do, now if Chriſt have not ſaid it, nor it be not in the Law and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is not, it may not be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. Nay, for the Magiſtrate to ſet apart Officers in the Church, croſſeth the Law of Chriſt, which is, that the Church, by a free choiſe, ſhould ſet them apart as it hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Again, Magiſtrates may not puniſh offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as in point of conſcience, for Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30, 38. For there he ſaith, that the children of the kingdome, and the children of the wicked one, ſhall both grow together in the field of the world, till the end; yea, the Jewes that blaſpeme againſt Chriſt, are to be ſuffered, for they are beloved of God, for their fathers ſake, though they be enemies to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. and when the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. So then the Jewes be to have liberty, that is plain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ought to have liberty of conſcience, that's as plain.</p>
               <p>So then the Magiſtrate hath not any power in the Church, more then any other member, but the power lieth in the whole Church, to caſt out offenders, as hath been ſhewed; but in all civil affaires, as all ſins againſt the ſecond Table, yea in all things that be civil, that helongs to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170393:64"/>Common-wealth, the Magiſtrate is ſupreme, and the whole Church is to obey him, and honour him, as the ſupreme in every civil thing, for the Lords ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. paying <hi>cuſtome to whom cuſtome belongeth,</hi> and tribute as he, or they hath and doth appoint, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. from ver 1. to 10. Yea, let them not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute who is Cheif Magiſtrate, no not by any means, by warr, but rather ſubmit to the cheif Magiſtrate in being, in every Nation.</p>
               <p>So then from all this that hath been ſaid, it doth appear and that very clearly, yea moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently from the Scriptures of truth, that God is a God of love and mercy, and is long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the riches of his goodneſs, and bounty doth abound moſt freely, and graciouſly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, and would have none periſh, but would have all come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved: and that the way of Chriſt is a way of love, in that he laid down his life for all men, yea though they were and are enemies, he tenders the word of the Goſpel, even glad tydings of peace, beſeeching by himſelf, and by his ſervants, (though they do abuſe them) to be reconciled to God; O how meek, and lowly in heart was the Lord Jeſus? how doth his love, and goodneſs appear, in that he being in the <hi>form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with him, made himſelf of no reputation, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170393:65"/>took upon him the forme of a ſervant; and was made in the likeneſs of man, and being found in the faſhion of a man, he humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs;</hi> And ſo the Lord of life and Glory, by whom all things were created, beſeecheth the creature, to be reconciled to God, and ſo to obey him in love, and walk up in the way of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is a way of love; for the love of God being ſpread abroad in the heart, men having from the God of love received gifts, the love of Chriſt conſtraineth to preach the Goſpel, and to feed the flock of Chriſt, and to ſeek up them that go aſtray; and the Saints in love miniſter and communicate unto them what they want, and ſo Miniſters are choſen in love, and their Doctrin is heard in love, and received in love, and the poor relieved in love, and them that ſin are dealt with in love, and their meetings of the Church, and feaſts are in love, and their Communion in Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread is in love, &amp; ſo al duty is to be done (without murmurings, and diſputings) in love, &amp; ſo Faith in Chriſt is available working by love; &amp; ſo the children of God receive the kingdome as a reward in love, given by the God of love; ſo all the way of Chriſt is a way of love, &amp; his word is the Doctrine of love; So let all the Saints conclude with the Spouſe, his <hi>mouth is moſt ſweet, yea, he is altogether lovely,</hi> Cant. 5.16.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170393:65"/>And ſo this way of love, which is the good old way of the Goſpel, was of old at firſt confirmed <hi>by ſigns, and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, according to his own will,</hi> Heb. 2.4. Therefore let every man in the fear of God walk therein, and they ſhall <hi>find reſt for their Souls,</hi> Jer. 6.16. Yea, let every member of the Church of Chriſt, <hi>put on the whole Armour of God, having their loynes girt about with truth, and their feet ſhod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Goſpel of peace;</hi> and <hi>praying alwayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> Eph. 5.13, 14.15, 16, 17, 18. O that every one would lay it to heart, and with <hi>fear and trembling, work out their Salvation;</hi> for in theſe <hi>laſt dayes, will be perrilous times,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.1. and <hi>many that have taſted of the good word of God, and been enlightned,</hi> ſo as to beleeve the truth, will <hi>fall away from grace;</hi> yea, from the true faith, ſo as that eternal death will be their portion; yea, ſome have fallen from the faith, therefore it is no new thing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the warnings in Scripture proves this, exhorting men to take heed that they do not <hi>fall away from the grace of God,</hi> Heb. 12.15. and theſe warnings and exhortations are given to ſuch as have received the truth, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as it appeareth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. from
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170393:66"/>6. to 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. reads it thus, <hi>Take heed Brethren, leaſt at any time there be in any of you, an evil heart, and unfaithful, to depart away from the living God,</hi> Heb. 4.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2, 3. All theſe are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings given in Scripture, and very many more might be brought, which exhort men to take heed that they do not depart from the truth, which would be in vain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. if men could not fall away, therefore they may, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Threatnings, if any do fall away prove this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.26. reads it thus, <hi>If we ſin willingly, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more Sacrifice for ſin:</hi> and chap. 6.4, 5, 6. is very full to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, then after they have known it, to turn fom the holy commandment delivered unto them,</hi> Rev. 3.3. Ezek. 18.26. you may read alſo, which plainly proves this point.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This appears by examples in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true of ſome that did fall away from the truth; yea, from the true faith, as <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 26.25.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170393:66"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 1.17, 18. and <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and <hi>Balaam</hi> who ſpake excellent things by the help of the Spirit of God, as the other Prophets of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. <hi>Jude</hi> 11, 12. and ſome making <hi>ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. and <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phyletus,</hi> who <hi>concerning the truth have erred, ſaying, the reſurrection is past already, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the faith of ſome,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Scripture ſpeaking prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, faith expreſly, <hi>That in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.3, 4. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Jud.</hi> 14, 15, 16. All theſe Scriptures do foretell of ſome, yea, many in the latter times ſhall fall away, ſo as to depart from the faith, and give <hi>heed to Doctrines of Devils, and ſhall privily bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them;</hi> and many more places might be brought for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Metaphors, and Proverbs in Scripture proves this alſo, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.49, 50. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43, 44. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. that in <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth, that they which have been freed of their <hi>vomit,</hi> and have been <hi>waſhed,</hi> yet turned as a <hi>Dog</hi> to it again, <hi>as a Dog to the vomit again, and the Sow to the wallowing in the mire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, if this were not ſo, no man could ſin
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170393:67"/>againſt the Spirit, nor none could be Reprobates, for the ſin againſt the Spirit, is a ſin of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and againſt the conſcience, they do that which they are convinced they ought not to do, as it appeareth, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.22, to 31. compared with <hi>John</hi> 7.20, 28.

And conſidering, that this which I do in this work may be ſeaſonable, and for much profit to the People of God, and for the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; I ſhall ſhew in brief, that the Whore is not the Antichriſt: And for the clearing up of this truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you may ſee who this great Whore of Babylon is, by noting her chief ſeat where it is, and that is at <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. That the <hi>great Whore of Babylon,</hi> which <hi>ſitteth upon many Waters,</hi> is that City which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170393:73"/>
                  <hi>reigneth over the Kings of the earth;</hi> now <hi>Rome</hi> only was the chief City, and reigned over the Kings of the earth, when <hi>John</hi> wrote the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for when Chriſt was born, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Ceſar</hi> taxed all the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. And when <hi>Paul</hi> appeals to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> they ſend him to <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 25.11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.1. and 28.16. So it is plain by theſe Scriptures and many more, that when <hi>John</hi> wrote the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> reigned over the kings of the earth; therefore the chief ſeat of this Woman the great Whore, the Mother of Whoredomes, is the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo then the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Cardinals, Biſhops, with the reſt of the Clergy, (as they call themſelves) and all Miniſters that have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from them immediately, or by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which ſtand in a Nationall way, is the Whore that ſits upon many Waters; which is People, and Multitudes, and Nations, and tongues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſtanding, is truly ſaid to be Whoriſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe bringeth in members, and accounteth them of the Body or Church of Chriſt by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and ſo maketh her Church Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; whereas the Church of Chriſt is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or new birth, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. And ſo not National nor Dependant, but particular, or Independant.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:170393:73"/>
               <p>Thirdly, This appeareth fully, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a Mother of Harlots, and all National Churches that ſpring from her, are Whoriſh, and ſo are her daughters becauſe ſhe baptiſeth or ſpringleth upon a fleſhly account, and ſo accounteth of her Members in a fleſhly way by generation, and ſo brings in Infants in a lineal way, bringing in the old covenant in a confuſed manner, and ſo receiveth falſe ſeed, and ſo knoweth her members, and her children in a fleſhly way, contrary to the expreſſe way of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. ſaith he, <hi>They which are the children of the fleſh are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15, 16, 17. he ſheweth, that ſince the death of Chriſt, <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh, yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more; therefore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature; old things are paſſed away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Presbyters which ſpring from her, for they hold their Ordination which they had of her, and their Infant-Baptiſme which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> adminiſtred to them, and ſo ſhew themſelves to be Whoriſh; they have <hi>forſaken</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (the Head)

But this Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot contrariwiſe brings up her Miniſtry to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, in ſending them to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and there they learn Philoſophy from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> a Heathen Author; and ſuch like, and for them that are gifted by the Lord, if they preach, ſhe forbids them. But on the contrary, note alſo, that the Miniſters of Chriſt miniſtring by gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7. being qualified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1. and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Congregation of the Lord, they are Choſen by them, and Ordained, and ſo made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21. to the end, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.3. and 14.23. But this Harlot makes her Miniſters, or rather Lords, without the conſent of her Pariſhes, and forceth them in upon them whether they will or no, and ſo her Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is by Tythes forced from men, bringing in the old Prieſthood; yea, in the time of the Law they did not impriſon men, if they did not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170393:74"/>pay their Tythes that we find, and yet ſhe doth; and ſo this <hi>Romiſh</hi> Harlot hath made <hi>all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drunk with the wine of her fornication;</hi> her Children are children of fornication, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh by generation, a carnal ſeed conſiſting of Pariſhes, many of which conſiſt of Swearers, Liars, Drunkards, Whoremongers, and ſuch like; and a humane carnal miniſtry forced upon the people, and forced mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and alſo her poor is maintained by force, and forcing men to worſhip with her, or elſe Fines, impriſonment, Baniſhment, or Death muſt be their portion; and alſo ſhe hath changed the Ordinances, and the manner of adminiſtring them, and the ſubject, and ſo her way is not the way of love, and ſo not the way of Chriſt, and yet ſhe ſaith in her heart and word, <hi>I am, and there is none elſe,</hi> I ſit being a Queen, and am no Widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow; and ſo let every one weigh well what is ſaid, that the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi> were once famous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. but in time they departed from their eſpouſed Chriſt the Lord, and ſo came to change the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; and yet ſhe pretends to be the Spouſe of Chriſt, having a ſhew of all the Ordinances, or the names of them, for Believers baptiſme, ſhe hath Infants ſprinkling, and for Laying on of Hands, ſhe hath Confirmation, or Biſhoping, but the Presbyters have left this out, and in this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170393:75"/>they are nearer Antichriſt then the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and for Breaking of Bread, or the Lords Supper, that is in part miniſtred unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Pariſh, and ſo to the wrong ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not penitent, nor baptiſed perſons; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the true Call to her Miniſtry, ſhe hath a humane way as hath been ſhewed, which is not mentioned in Scripture; and ſo Tythes and forced Maintenance, inſtead of that which is by free gift; and inſtead of ſinging with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and with the underſtanding alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. ſhe hath ſinging in Rhime, in a carnal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall way, many together without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Pſalms</hi> being collected into Engliſh meeter, by <hi>Tho.

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170393:75"/>17.5, 6. &amp; that is &amp; will be the cauſe of her fall, and that brings me to the ſecond thing, even the fall of this Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; the manner how and by whom; and for the clearing up of this;</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider that this Woman ſits upon a <hi>ſcarlet colloured Beaſt,</hi> full of the <hi>names of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> which had <hi>ſeven heads and ten hornes, Rev.</hi> 17.3. Now note, that five of them heads, or kings were fallen, when <hi>John</hi> wrote the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and the ſixt was then in being, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. Now this Woman the Harlot, was to ſit upon the ſixt head, and hath ſo done a long time, and ſo the beaſt that had ſeven Heads carrieth her &amp; beareth her up, forthe Magiſtrates have ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her all along; underſtand alſo, that the fixt Head of the Beaſt hath reigned ever ſince the writing of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but now is partly ſtrong and partly broken; &amp; that the ſixt Head is not fallen, is plain if you note well, for the ſeventh Head when he cometh, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a ſhort ſpace; now that head of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monarthy which is in being, hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, even from before the birth of Chriſt; for <hi>Rome</hi> was governed by <hi>Emperours</hi> before the birth of Chriſt, <hi>Lnke</hi> 2.1. and the imperial power ſtandeth yet, though it be tranſlated into <hi>Germany;</hi> therefore the Imperial Head cannot be the ſeventh Head, becauſe that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long; and that the ſeventh Head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170393:76"/>but a ſhort ſpace, note, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Five are fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come, and when he cometh, he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace;</hi> Alſo mark well, that the power of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy, cannot be the ſeventh Head, for they have continued long.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Whore cannot be any of the Heads of the Beaſt, becauſe ſhe ſits upon, and is carried by the Beaſt that hath ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, ſo ſhe cauſeth the Beaſt to ſerve her, and maketh the Beaſts and the Kings of the earth ſlaves to her, to do her will; ſo then the ſixt Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> power is not fallen, though it be in part, and the ſeventh Head is now ariſing, which will take away the ſixth, and doth, will, and muſt give ſome liberty to preach the Goſpel, and to adminiſter the Ordinances in the old way thereof; and ſo the Lord God will bring things to paſs; <hi>for not one jot or tittle of his word ſhall fail;</hi> and ſo in the riſing and reign of the ſeventh Head, and the ten Hornes, the <hi>Angel ſhall flie in the midſt of Heaven, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the everlaſting Goſpel, to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every Nation, and kindred, and tongue and people; ſaying with a loud voyce, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come, and worſhip him that made heaven and earth, the Sea, and the fountaines of waters,</hi> Rev. 14.6, 7. So the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170393:76"/>and the way thereof being preached, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be enlightned, and ſo God will put it into the hearts of the ten Hornes, or Kings, <hi>to hate the Whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire.</hi> Rev. 17.12, 16. So through the preaching of the Goſpel in the pure way thereof, the great Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> falleth, and ſo the hour of her judgment is come; and to this agreeth that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8. which ſheweth, that after the Goſpel is preached to the Nations, then ſhall <hi>follow another Angel ſaying, it is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great City, for ſhe made all Nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,</hi> ver. 8. Much more might be ſpoken to this, but let this ſuffice as touching what the Whore is, and her fall, the manner how, and by whome?</p>
               <p>In the next place, note diligently what the ſpirit of Antichriſt is, and who have that ſpirit; now <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. And <hi>ver.</hi> 3. doth declare what the ſpirit of Antichriſt is; namely, <hi>every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is not of God; and this is that ſpirit of Antichriſt, whereof you have heard that he ſhould come, and even now already is in the world.</hi> Alſo underſtand, that <hi>John</hi> did not intend the heathen that never did beleeve, nor the unbelieving <hi>Jewes,</hi> which never did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170393:77"/>Chriſt come in the fleſh; but thoſe have the ſpirit of Antichriſt, that went out from the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>John</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that it is the laſt time, and as you have heard, that Antichriſt ſhall come, even now are there many Antichriſts, whereby we know that it is the laſt time; <hi>They went out From us,</hi> &amp;c. So that the ſpirit of Antichriſt, is that ſpirit that is found in them that have been enlightned, and have known the truth, and go out from the Church of Chriſt, and in a myſtery deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Antichriſt, or Man of Sin, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. ſaith, <hi>The <hi>Myſtery</hi> of iniquity, doth already work</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking to the Saints, ſaith (in his 2 Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. 2.1.) <hi>there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who <hi>Privily,</hi> ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the <hi>Lord</hi> that <hi>Bought them,</hi> and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction;</hi> So the ſpirit of Antichriſt denyes Chriſt come in the fleſh ſecretly, and they that have this ſpirit, ſay, Chriſt is come in their fleſh, and ſo ſay the light within them is Chuiſt; when at the beſt it is but the light of nature, and in many the ſpirit of errour; their light being become darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered up to ſtrong deluſion, to believe lyes, thinking they have Chriſt in them, when it is a ſpirit of errour, and ſo pervert the ſence of the Scriptures, declaring the Annointing, and the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170393:77"/>Annointed to be all one, teaching up the ſpirit of Chriſt, apart from the Body of Chriſt, to be the Chriſt, or rather the ſpirit of error in them, to be the Chriſt come in their fleſh; &amp; ſo in a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable ſecret way, deny Chriſtcome in the fleſh, in ſaying, he is the Chriſt that is within them, which is an evil ſpirit, ſo applying the Scriptures that ſpeak of the ſpirit of Chriſt dwelling in men, to be that evil ſpirit in them; ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſpirit of errour in them apart from the body, or fleſh of Chriſt, to be the Chriſt, &amp; ſo deny Chriſt come in the fleſh; but note well, what the Scriptures of truth ſaith, they declare that Jeſus Chriſt was ſlain, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.10. in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.30. <hi>Peter</hi> who was full of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, ſaith, <hi>the God of our fathers hath <hi>Raiſed</hi> up Jeſus, whom ye <hi>flew,</hi> and <hi>hanged</hi> on a tree;</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4. <hi>Firſt of all, I delivered unto you, that which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, how that Chriſt <hi>died</hi> for our ſins, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, and that he was <hi>Burſed,</hi> &amp; that he <hi>Aroſe</hi> the third day according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> So it is plain, that the ſpirit apart from the body or fleſh of Chriſt, is not the Chriſt; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore again note, what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, &amp; one meditatour, <hi>between</hi> God &amp; man, which is the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. ſheweth, that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> were <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the offering of the <hi>body</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, ver.</hi> 19.20. Seeing <hi>therefore brethren, that by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170393:78"/>
                     <hi>Blood</hi> of Jeſus, we may be bold to enter into the holieſt; by the new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the vail, that is, his <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                  </hi> So that Jeſus, that was Baptiſed of <hi>John</hi> in the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> was <hi>anointed with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellowes, Mat.</hi> 3.13, 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. So Jeſus the Saviour is the annointed of God, for he gave him not his <hi>Spirit</hi> by <hi>meaſure. John.</hi> 3.34. and ſo the ſpirit of the Lord did <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> upon the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. <hi>John</hi> 1.32. So then the ſpirit of God, or of Chriſt, apart from the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, is not the Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore moſt abominable is that which men ſay, that that which is in them is Chriſt, when it is a ſpirit of errour, and ſo men may ſee how through this Myſtery of iniquity, men come to ſay they are Chriſt; for conſider, if the ſpirit in ſome man be the Chriſt, what hindreth him to ſay he is Chriſt; and therefore ſome one preſumes to ſay he is Chriſt; Let no man miſtake me, for I ſay that the ſpirit of God doth dwell in the Saints, &amp; that Chriſt doth dwell in their hearts by faith; but note, that <hi>faith is the ſubſtance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11.1. So the <hi>juſt live by faith,</hi> and look for the <hi>Son of God from heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead, even Jeſus who delivereth us from the wrath to come.</hi> But to return, ſo as to ſhew yet further, who hath the ſpirit of Antichriſt, &amp; they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170393:78"/>are ſuch as race out the Ordinances of Chriſt, which came in being when Chriſt came in the fleſh, which plainly declare Chriſt come in the fleſh, dead, and riſen again, as baptiſme of Water, and Breaking of Bread, which doth declare the <hi>Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Now there are a ſort of men which ſay, to know or acknowledge Chriſt in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe Ordinances, is formal and ſleſhly. low, and carnal, and ſo reject the counſel of God, and will not be Baptiſed; and ſo not walking up in the Ordinances that did come in being, when Chriſt came in the fleſh, and do ſo excellently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him come in the fleſh, and are to continue untill Chriſt come from heaven, and <hi>change our vile bodies, and make them like his moſt glorious body, Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. I ſay, thoſe that do ſlight and reject thoſe Ordinances, and ſay, they are formal, and will not practice them, have the ſpirit of Antichriſt, &amp; do deny Chriſt come in the fleſh; becauſe they will not practice thoſe Ordinances that declare Chriſt come in the fleſh; yea, more fully then the Whore, for ſhe hath a ſhew, and ſo a remembrance of the Ordinances; though ſhe have changed the ſubject, &amp; the manner as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; but <hi>Theſe</hi> root out the very being of them (as much as in them lieth) and ſo deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, &amp; ſo are diſcovered to have the ſpirit of Antichriſt. Alſo thoſe that have been en,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170393:79"/>lightened, and have believed the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, and alſo the eternal Judgment, and then come to queſtion it, and deny it, and ſay the Judgment day is come, have the ſpirit of Antichriſt, for Chriſt being put to death in the fleſh, and riſing again from the dead, ſo bringeth in the Reſurrection of the <hi>Bodies</hi> of all men, &amp; then cometh in the eternal Judgment, according to that in <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30, 31. <hi>He hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by that <hi>Man</hi> whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath given aſſurance to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead; ſo as by man came death, by man came alſo the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead; For as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive, but every man in his own order; the firſt fruits is Chriſts, afterward they that are of Chriſt, at his coming,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22, 23. So Chriſt being come in the fleſh, the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt, Saviour, died and roſe again, and ſo comes in the Reſurrection, and no otherwiſe; therefore they that have been enlightned in the Reſurrection, &amp; the eternal Judgment, and come to ſay they are in the Reſurrection, or that it is paſt already, and ſo deny the Reſurrection of the body, deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, and ſo have the ſpirit of Antichriſt; and therefore <hi>John</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Saints, warning them that they take beed of the Antichriſtian ſpirit, that they be not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170393:79"/>deceived, exhorteth them thus; <hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; if that which you have heard from the beginning ſhall remaine in you; yea alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father,</hi> 1 John 2.24. read alſo for this purpoſe the whole <hi>Chapt.</hi> Now that which they heard from the beginning, was the beginning word of Chriſt, (according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4. which he delivered firſt of all to the <hi>Corinthians, That Chriſt <hi>Died</hi> for our ſins,</hi> according to the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and the firſt Principles of the word of God, which is the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, to wit, <hi>Repentance from dead works, and of Faith towards God, the Doctrine of Baptiſmes, and of Laying on of Hands, and of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, and of eternal Judgment, Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Chap</hi> 6.1, 2. Now theſe Principles of the teachings of Chriſt, came in being, by and through Chriſt, being manifeſt in fleſh, his death and Reſurrection, as hath been ſhewed before; therefore, <hi>whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> for he denies Chriſt come in the fleſh, and ſo he hath the ſpirit of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>John</hi> 6.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. and ſo there was many that had the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in the Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi> time, and ſo many Antichriſts, they are ſaid to be Antichriſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have the ſpirit of the Man of Sin, the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170393:80"/>Antichriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2, 3. But the Antichriſt, the Man of Sin, ſhall be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will the Spirit of the Devil, above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and ſo is ſaid to be, <hi>The</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>
                     <hi>The</hi> Man of Sin;</hi> And ſo having in part declared what is the Spirit of Antichriſt, and who hath that Spirit, I come now to the fourth thing which is,</p>
               <p>That Antichriſt will be a ſingle perſon.</p>
               <p>And for the proof of this; firſt conſider how the Antichriſt is ſet out in Scripture, in the ſingular number, not in the plural; as <hi>the <hi>Man</hi> of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. not men, and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Is this the <hi>Man</hi> that made the earth to tremble, and did ſhake the Kingdomes, the <hi>Son</hi> of the morning, and <hi>Son</hi> of perdition?</hi> not ſons; <hi>the vile Perſon,</hi> not Perſons, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.12. there fell a <hi>great Star from Heaven,</hi> not Stars.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>This in Iſa.</hi> 14. <hi>was fulfilled in Nebuchadnezzar King of Babel of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That cannot be, for after this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that is there ſpoken of is faln, the whole <hi>world is at reſt, and is quiet, they ſing for joy; yea, the Furr-trees rejoyce at thee, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of Lebanon, ſaying; ſince thou art laid down, no feller is come up againſt us, verſ.</hi> 7.8. Now the world did not enjoy ſuch a reſt as is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170393:80"/>there ſpoken of, ſo as that no Feller came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the People of God no more; for ſince the time of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies fall, there hath come up many fellers, or deſtroyers of the Jewes, and the believing Gentiles, as is clear, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the Jewes, and the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the Chriſtians; and again the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. takes up the ſame words in ſubſtance, and applies them to the man of ſin, which is the Antichriſt; therefore that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> cannot be fulfilled in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> (for this compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13, 14. with 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 4.) though he might be a type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it appears that the Antichriſt will be but one man (though many have his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo many Antichriſts) becauſe it will ſute beſt with his way of deluſion, for he will pretend he is the very Chriſt, and will cauſe <hi>fire to come down from Heaven on earth in the ſight of men, Rev.</hi> 13.13. and ſo he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to imitate Chriſt in all things, for as the Lord Chriſt ſhall be <hi>revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know not God, and that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo the Antichriſt, will make fire come down from heaven in the ſight of men, he will endeavour
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170393:81"/>to make all the Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſts coming, and of his raign to meet upon him; <hi>So</hi> his coming will be after the <hi>working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. So, as there is the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of the living God, which came in his Fathers name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi> 5.4, 3. without ſin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. So there will be the <hi>Man</hi> of Sin, the Antichriſt, which will come in his own name, and profeſs to be the Chriſt, but will be directly an enemy againſt Chriſt and his People.</p>
               <p>And ſo I come to the fifth thing; which is, the manner of Antichriſts riſing, and by what means; for the clearing up of this; Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Goſpel, and the way thereof, is to be purely preached, and the Ordinances rightly adminiſtred, and ſo the Angel is to <hi>fly in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and People, Rev.</hi> 14.6. And ſo the Goſpel being preached to the Nations, and the Ordinances Adminiſtred in the good old way, according to the Scriptures, men come to be enlightened, as many are in theſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170393:81"/>nations where the Kingly power is fallen, that did ſupport the Whore, and would not give liberty of conſcience; ſo I ſay, as the Goſpel comes to be miniſtred, in the old way thereof, men come to be enlightned, the power of the Whore falleth, and men ſlighting, and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, and alſo many of them that do receive and obey the truth, fall and depart from the faith, and ſo <hi>receiving not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved; for this cauſe</hi> God doth, and <hi>will ſend them ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that they ſhould believe a lye,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. And ſo are given up to the Spirit of Antichriſt; and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, that the day of Chriſts coming ſhall not come except there come a <hi>falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3. and ſo the Spirit ſpeaking expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall <hi>depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrine of Devils, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie, having their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſeared with an hot Iron; forbidding to marry,</hi> &amp;c. as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writing to the Saints in his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2. ſheweth, that there ſhall be <hi>falſe teachers among you, who ſhall privily bring in damnable Hereſies, even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Lord that bought them, and bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170393:82"/>themſelves ſwift deſtruction; and many ſhall follow their pernitious</hi> wicked <hi>wayes; by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of;</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3, 4. he ſaith, that there <hi>ſhould be ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo men tranſgreſſing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, fall from the faith of the Goſpel; and ſo the ſpirit of God departs from them, and an evil ſpirit is ſent unto them, which is the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſo out from them that thus fall away, and go out from the Church, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. and ſo ſeperate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the ſpirit, as <hi>Jude</hi> hath it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. and alſo from them that have been enlightened, and have neglected to walk up in truth, and ſo reject the counſel of God, as the Lawyers and Phariſees did, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. ſo I ſay, from them that ſo fall away, and neglect to hear and obey the Goſpel, from them ariſeth the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, or man of ſin.</p>
               <p>Again, the ſixth Head of the Roman Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, which is the imperial, or Kingly power, hath alwayes, and doth by the guidance of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the National Miniſtry (which rides upon the Beaſt as hath been ſhewed) perſecute men for their Conſciences, and ſo hath let and hindered the Goſpel from being preached, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170393:82"/>the Ordinances from being rightly adminiſtred, and ſo the light of truth was exceedingly kept back, and but few received it, and them that did receive it, ſhe perſecuted, ſome ſhe put to death, others ſhe baniſhed, or cauſed to fly into ſtrange Countries, and into howling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, others impriſoned, and fined, and ſo ſhe cometh to be drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, and ſo the Goſpel could not be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the pure way thereof, to every Nation, kindred, tongue, and people, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. And ſo alſo, if any did ariſe that had the ſpirit of Antichriſt, ſhe took him off alſo, and ſo ſhe pluck'd up much wheat, and tares alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.29, 30. <hi>Let both grow together until Harveſt,</hi> &amp;c. So the ſixt Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy being rid upon, &amp; guided by the Whore, did let the Goſpel from being preached, and the Antichriſt from riſing; and ſo I think that the fixth Head did hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the man of Sin in the Apoſtles dayes, for the Emperours being heathens then, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Saints, and ſo that ſixth Head ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, and carrying the Whore alſo, ſo as that it did let, and will let, until it be taken out of the way, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. but now the ſixth Head being in part taken away; and the ſeventh Head ariſing, he giving ſome liberty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170393:83"/>of conſcience, the Goſpel is preached, and truth appears, and many receive the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it, and obey it, and many fall away from it, and ſo the ſpirit of Antichriſt ariſeth, and ſo the ſeventh Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt ſhall take away the ſixth Head, and ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a ſhort ſpace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.10. and ſo the ten Horns alſo ſhall ariſe in one hour with the beaſt that was, and is not, even he is the Eighth, and is of the Seventh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12. and ſo is the little Horn that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.11, 24, 25. and the laſt power, or Beaſt, the Antichriſt, the Man of Sin, and ſo the ſeventh Head and ten Horns, or Kings giving liberty, the ſervants of God ſends forth the truth as it is in Jeſus, miniſtring in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel glad tidings of the Kingdome to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, men come to know the truth, and ſo are enlightened with it, and ſo many may come to ſhine as Stars, and yet fall away as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, or man of ſin, himſelf will be ſome notable man ſhining as a Star for a time, yet afterward falling from the truth, according to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>The third Angel ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and there fell a great Star from Heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, and the name of the Star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170393:83"/>became Worm-wood, and many men dyed of the waters, becauſe they were made bitter.</hi> So the man of Sin falls from the truth, or true Church, as a great Star from Heaven, burning like a Lamp, through Satans transforming himſelf as into an Angel of light, and ſo falls upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and fountains of waters, ſo that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them bitter: ſo the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel; and the way of Chriſt, in which men ſhall be made partakers of the waters of life, and ſo made glad in the City of God, are ſo made bitter like Wormwood, changing the taſte of them, ſo that many men die of thoſe waters, according to that of <hi>Jude</hi> 12. <hi>Twice dead plucked up by the roots;</hi> and thus he cauſeth men to fall, <hi>ſo that the third part of the Sun is ſmitten, and the third part of the Moon, and the third part of the Stars, ſo as the third part of them is darkned, and the day ſhone not for a third part of it, nor the night likewiſe, Rev.</hi> 8.12. The Sun is hear compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Church, becauſe the Church or Saints through Chriſt are ſaid to be the light of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14. and ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> who is called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream, is compared to the Sun, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.9, 10. The Moon I take to be the world, or the Whore, the falſe Church, which hath her light from the true Church, as the Moon hath her light from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170393:84"/>the Sun, the Stars are the eminent teachers in the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. and this in the eight <hi>chapter</hi> before ſpoken of, is an allegory, becauſe the waters are ſaid to become Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and yet men drink of them, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, if they were made Wormwood; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Allegorical, that the word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the miniſtration of the Prophets is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to water, look <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.18, 19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. So then a many of the Church will fall from the faith, and the Stars, the Elders, or chief teachers alſo, and many of the World, or falſe Church that ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and will not obey, ſhall be darkned, and ſo ſhall loſe that light they have, and ſo ſhall be given up to groſs darkneſs, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great falling away from the truth; <hi>So</hi> the man of Sin, the Antichriſt is revealed, and getteth the power and rule by flatteries, <hi>after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs; and <hi>So</hi> oppoſeth &amp; exalteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> or is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that <hi>
                     <hi>He</hi> as God, ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God, Dan.</hi> 11.21. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 9, 10. And ſo I come to the ſixth Particular, which is,</p>
               <p>Some of the great things that the man of Sin willdo, with his falſe Prophet.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:170393:84"/>
               <p>Which in the firſt place take what <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith of him, ſetting him out by a little Horne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.8, 11, 24, 25. he ſaith, <hi>That he ſhall ſubdue three Kings, and he ſhall ſpeak <hi>Great</hi> words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt high, and ſhall wear out the Saints of the moſt high, and think to change times and lawés; and they ſhall be given into his hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a time, and times, and the deviding of times;</hi> And ſo he ſhall reign in full power three years and a half, for time is taken for one year, times, for two years, and half a time, for half a year, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25. ſome tranſlation reads, for ſeven times, ſeven years, and ſo the <hi>woman Cloathed with the Sun,</hi> that <hi>flies from him into the wilderneſs,</hi> and is there three years and a half, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1, 14. ſo he ſhall preſecute the Saints of the moſt high, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 17. and the falſe prophet cauſeh the firſt beaſt <hi>whoſe deadly wound was healed, to be worſhipped, and he doth great wonders, ſo that he maketh fire to come down from heaven on the earth in the ſight of men; &amp; deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by means of thoſe miracles, which he ſhall have power to do in the ſight of the beaſt; ſaying, to them that dwell on the earth, that they ſhould make an image to the beaſt, which had the wound by a ſword, &amp; did live; &amp; had power to give life, or breath to the image of the beaſt, that the image of the beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as

So the Beaſt that hath a wound with a ſword, that is, the ſeventh Head is ſlain to death, yet he having another which is of the ſeventh, and is the eighth, and ſo liveth; and ſo it is the Beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is, and ſo the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall by miracles, cauſe the world to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt, the man of ſin, the Antichriſt, <hi>as God, ſitting in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. and cauſe as many as will not <hi>worſhip the beaſt or his image, to be killed;</hi> and ſo the fallen Star before mentioned, which is the Beaſt, the Antichriſt, <hi>aſcendeth out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, the key of the bottomleſs pit being given him, he openeth the bottomleſs pit, and then ariſeth a ſmoak out of the pit, as the ſmoak of a furnace, and the Sun, and the air, will be darkned, by reaſon of the ſmoak of the Pit,</hi> Rev. 11.7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.1, 2. and neer the end of his raign, when the ſixt Vial is poured, or pouring out, then ſhall come <hi>three unclean ſpirits like frogs out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beaſt, and out of the mouth of the

That if <hi>they worſhip the Beaſt, or his image, and receive his mark in their foreheads, or in their hands; The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation, and he ſhall be tormented with ſire and brimſtone,

               <p>So then we may ſee, that the Whore is not the Antichriſt, that the Scripture ſpeaks of, for the Whore is ſet out in Scripture thus, as a Woman, a falſe Church, as a Queen, The Mother of Harlots, and ahominations of the earth; The Antichriſt is ſet out thus; A Man of Sin, The man that did ſhake kingdomes, The Son of the Morning, The Son of Perdition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſixth Head of the Roman Beaſt carrieth the Harlot, but the Antichriſt, the Man of Sin is the eighth and laſt Beaſt, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Whore confeſſeth Chriſt to be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170393:87"/>come in the fleſh, and hath a ſhew, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Ordinances, though ſhe have changed the ſubject and manner; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt denies Chriſt come into the fleſh, and his Ordinances that declare him come in the fleſh, as it hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Woman, the Harlot, and her members that do worſhip according to her Traditions, and inventions, have ſpace given them to repent, and many do repent; but they that do worſhip the Beaſt, the Antichriſt, or receive his mark in their right hand, or in their fore-head, they cannot repent; they muſt <hi>drink of the wrath of God,</hi> &amp;c. as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10. and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.11. <hi>They repented not of their deeds;</hi> note, that the firſt <hi>vial</hi> is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon the <hi>earth,</hi> and the men that had the <hi>mark</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>worſhipped his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> are plagued; therefore none of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are poured out until the Antichriſt raigneth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The <hi>ten Horns</hi> hate the <hi>Whore,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> her, and make her <hi>deſolate, Rev.</hi> 17.16. But the Antichriſt is taken <hi>alive,</hi> when the Lord <hi>cometh,</hi> and puniſhed with <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deflruction from the preſence of the Lord, in a lake of fire,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.</p>
               <p>And ſo to draw to a concluſion, I do deſire
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170393:88"/>all men to take heed to the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles, for they are <hi>able to make men wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> and if men <hi>ſpeak not according to the Law and Teſtament, it is becauſe they have no light in them. Iſa.</hi> 8.20. O give heed to the moſt <hi>ſure word of the Prophets, as unto a light ſhining in a dark place. until the day of Chriſt dawn, and the day Star ariſe in your hearts;</hi> noting diligently all things that are <hi>ſpoken</hi> of, that muſt <hi>come</hi> to <hi>paſs,</hi> for when the <hi>ſigns</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſts coming</hi> are <hi>come to paſs,</hi> the day of Chriſts perſonal appearing will dawn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is there ſuch a ſpirit of deluſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, wherein is a myſtery of iniquity? Then let all take heed, that they ſeek the <hi>Lord while he may be found, and to kiſs the Son leſt he be angry; and ye periſh in the way;</hi> O do not neglect to read, and ſearch the Scriptures, and walk up in that you do know, <hi>be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God will not be mocked; what a man ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he ſhall reap, for he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption, but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting, Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is it ſo, that God doth, and will give up men to a Spirit of deluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhould <hi>believe a lye,</hi> that they all might be damned who <hi>believed not the truth, but had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170393:88"/>in unrighteouſneſs?</hi> Then he exhorted from hence, to forſake all unrighteous wayes in converſation, and all whoriſh inventions of men in point of Worſhip; for if <hi>Moſes</hi> Law be aboliſhed, which was given to him by the Lord, let no man think that he ſhall be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed if he worſhip according to mens inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let all the Saints conſider, and lay to heart what hath been ſpoken, and ſearch the Scriptures, that they may be informed what is to come to paſs, and ſo according to Chriſts exhortation, in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. <hi>Watch ye therefore, and pray alwayes, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the ſon of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover when the Lord thus overthrows Antichriſt and his Armies, and the Kings of the earth, as it hath been ſhewed before, and more plentiouſly appeareth in Scripture; <hi>When the whirle wind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a cutting whirle-wind, it ſhall remain with pain upon the head of the wicked; the fearce anger of the Lord ſhall not return, until he have performed the intents of his heart; At the ſame time, ſaith the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Iſrael, and they ſhall be my people: For God hath loved them with an

Then at that day, the Lord himſelf which was <hi>dead and aroſe again, and is alive for evermore, Rev.</hi> 1.18. ſhall <hi>deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. compared with <hi>Iſa</hi> 27.13. and ſo as <hi>Zach.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord my God ſhall come and all the Saints with thee, and his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jeruſalem,</hi> Chap. 14.4, 5. then the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of Hoſts, and Lord

               <p>And for the further proof and clearing up of this truth, That the Lord Chriſt ſhall raign perſonally on the earth, more then a thouſand years, and all the Saints with him, from <hi>Adam</hi> to his coming, which dyed in the faith, and are found in the faith at his coming, are to raign with him upon earth; Firſt, conſider and mark well what the Scripture ſaith in the letter of it, for the proof of the ſame, the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righteous branch, and a King ſhall raign and prosper, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgment and juſtice in the earth; In his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is his name, the Lord our Righteouſneſs, Chap.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Ask of me and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>In his dayes ſhall the righteous flowriſh, and abundance of peace ſhall be ſo long as the Moon endureth; He ſhall have dominion alſo from Sea to Sea, and from the river unto the end of the earth; Yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all nations ſhall ſerve him, Pfal.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:170393:90"/>72.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>His name ſhall endure for ever, his name ſhall be continued as long as the Sun; and men ſhall be bleſſed in him: All nations ſhall call him bleſſed; and the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth; in that day ſhall there be one Lord, and his name one, Zach.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>And the Kingdome and dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high; whoſe Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome; and all nations</hi> or dominions, <hi>ſhall ſerve and obey him;</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made us unto our God Kings &amp; Prieſts, &amp; we ſhall raign on the earth, Chap.</hi> 11.15. <hi>And the ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were great voyces in heaven; ſaying, the Kingdomes of this world, are become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt; and he ſhall raign for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 20. ſheweth at large, That the <hi>Saints ſhall raign with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years;</hi> which cannot be underſtood but to be on the earth.</p>
               <p>So then the letter of the Scripture ſpeaks much, that the Lord Chriſt ſhall <hi>deſcend from heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.11. <hi>and his feet ſhall ſtand upon mount Olives, which is before Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Zach.</hi> 14.4. and that he ſhall <hi>raign</hi> on the <hi>earth</hi> with his <hi>Saints;</hi> And that it may not appear a ſtrange thing, obſerve well how the Scriptures were taken in the letter,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170393:90"/>that ſpake of Chriſt to come in the fleſh, and his ſufferings; as, <hi>A virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, Iſa.</hi> 7.14. Chriſt the <hi>King of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, riding upon an Aſs, and upon a coult the foal of an Aſs, Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.5. of their giving <hi>him vineger to drink, Pſal.</hi> 69.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.48. again the <hi>ſelling</hi> of Chriſt the <hi>Lord of life and glory, for thirty pieces of ſilver, Zach.</hi> 11.12.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.9. Much more might be ſaid, to ſhew that ſtrange things were fore-told by the Propheſies in the Scripture, concerning the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and his ſuffering, and riſing from the dead, plainly declared in the letter; yea, men hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed them until they were fulfilled. So then the Scriptures ſpeaking plainly alſo of the Lord Chriſt deſcending from heaven to the earth, and to raign on the earth with his Saints, (as it hath been ſhewed before) why ſhould it be thought to be uncredible.</p>
               <p>Again there is a ſtream of Scriptures that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that the Saints ſhall ſuffer perſecution, and be in tribulation until the coming of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.2, 27. <hi>Acts.</hi> 14.22. Yea, the neerer the coming of Chriſt, the greater trouble to the Saints, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. Alſo the Scriptures declare plentiouſly,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170393:91"/>that the Saints ſhall <hi>raign</hi> on the <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>flouriſh exceedingly,</hi> and that a <hi>long time, Pſal.</hi> 72.7. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.21, 22, 23. <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.15.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve it well, how can this ſtand or conſiſt, that the Saints muſt from Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſh, to his coming to Judgment ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecution and tribulation, and yet muſt have a long time to raign and flouriſh, ſeeing reigning over the earth and flouriſhing, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant, for men cannot be at one time in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, troubled, afflicted condition, and in a raigning, flouriſhing ſtate; therefore I ſay, that Chriſt muſt reign on the earth, and appoint his people a kingdome, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29, 30. and ſo they ſhall reign with him on the earth.</p>
               <p>Again there is a ſtream of Scriptures, that declareth, that there ſhould be <hi>warrs, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of warrs</hi> in the laſt dayes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.6, 7. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. Yea, the fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which is the <hi>Roman</hi> power, which did begin to raign before Chriſt, came in the fleſh, and hath raigned in the ſixth Head, and will raign in the ſeventh and eighth, which is of the ſeventh of that <hi>Roman</hi> power, untill Chriſt come as hath been ſhewed before; hath all a long brought in warrs, and doth and will to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170393:91"/>the coming of Chriſt; for the Scriptures ſhew, that this fourth power, will break in peeces and ſubdue all, and ſtamp the reſidue with the feet of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.7. So there hath been no long peace, but deviſion, and warrs, and is and will be more and more, untill the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.42, 43. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.24, 25. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Exek</hi> 38. <hi>Chap.</hi> 39. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.17, 18, 19. So then, by the Scripture it appeareth from the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, to the coming of Chriſt from heaven, to judge the quick and the dead; there hath, and will be warr; and to this Hiſtories agree alſo, that there hath not been no long peace in the world, ſince the Jewes cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but very much warr.</p>
               <p>But the Scripture ſheweth plentiouſly alſo, that there ſhall be a long peace in the whole world; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.7, 8. in his dayes, ſhall the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous flouriſh, and abundance of peace, ſo long as the Moon endureth,</hi> Zach. 9.10. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 14.7. <hi>The whole world is at reſt, and is quiet, they break forth into ſinging,</hi> Mich. 4.3, 4. <hi>And he ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong Nations after off, and they ſhall beat there ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks; Nation ſhall not lift up a ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learne <hi>Warr any More:</hi> But they ſhall ſit every man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170393:92"/>under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hoſts hath ſpoken it, Iſa.</hi> 2.4. So then there hath been and will be warr untill Chriſt comes, &amp; yet there muſt be a long time of peace, and this peace never was, nor cannot be untill Chriſt comes; (as the Scriptures of truth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) and then if the earth be utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſome ſay, then that peace cannot be; But I ſay with the Prophet, that that peace muſt be, and it cannot be untill Chriſt comes; therefore Chriſt will raign with all his Saints on the earth perſonally, and then he will <hi>make warr to ceaſe unto the ends of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the ſpear aſunder, he burneth the Chariot in the fire; ſaying, Be ſtill and know that Lam God, I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth,</hi> Pſal. 46.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Again the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, ſhall be called, as it hath been ſhewed before, which cannot be untill the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, and the appearing of Chriſt; and this will appear evidently if you well obſerve, what <hi>Iſa.</hi> ſaith, 59.20, 21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. for the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>when the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in; then the deliverer ſhall come to Sion, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170393:92"/>For this is my Covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away there ſins;</hi> And that you may ſee the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that remains on the earth when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles is come in; note well, the 25. <hi>verſe,</hi> and ſo to the 33. And alſo what hath been ſaid before, concerning this thing. So then the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be called to a glorious ſtate here on earth, when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles is come in; and then the deliverer the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall come to Sion, &amp; then ſhall <hi>they look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his onely Son, Zach.</hi> 12.10. So then, from all this, (and much more might be ſaid) it clearlly followeth, that the Lord ſhall reign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonaly on the earth, and ſo the Lord God ſhall give him the <hi>Throne of his Father David, and he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end, Luke</hi> 1.33.33.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place, take notice further of ſome of the excellent things that the Lord will do in that day for the houſe of Iſrael; <hi>In that day ſhall the branch of the Lord be beautiful, and the fruit of the earth ſhall be excellent, and comely, for them that are eſcaped of Iſrael. And it ſhall come to paſs, that he that is left in Sion, and he that remaineth in Jeruſalem, ſhall
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170393:93"/>be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jeruſalem; When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughters of Sion, &amp; ſhall have purged the blood of Jeruſalem from the midſt thereof, by the ſpirit of Judgment, and by the ſpirit of burning,</hi> Iſai. 4.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall <hi>health be reſtored unto Iſrael, and their wounds healed, ſaith the Lord, becauſe they called thee an out-caſt; ſaying, this is Sion whom no man ſeeketh after; Thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will bring again the captivity of Jacobs tents, and have mercy on his dwelling place, and the City ſhall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace ſhall remain after the manner thereof: And out of them ſhall proceed thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and the voyce of them that make merry; and I will multiply them, and they ſhall not be few, I will alſo glorifie them, and they ſhall not be ſmall,</hi> Jer. 30.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Again at this time, will the Lord <hi>make them one Nation in the land upon the mountains of Iſrael, and one King ſhall be a King to them all, and they ſhall be no more two Nations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they be devided into two kingdoms any more at all; Neither ſhall they defile themſelves any more with their Idols, nor with their deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, nor with any of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; but I will ſave them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have ſinned, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170393:93"/>will cleanſe them; ſo ſhall they be my people, and I will be their God,</hi> Ezekiel 37.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Wait yea upon me ſaith the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day that I riſe up to gather the Nations; that I may Aſſemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth ſhall be devoured with the fire of my jealouſie: For then will I turn to the people a pure Language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent; At this time I will bring you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, even in this time that I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praiſe among all people of the earth, when I turn back your cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity before your eyes, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zeph. 3.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Look upon Zion the City of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, thine eye ſhall ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that ſhall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords be broken: And the Inhabitants ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, the people that dwell therein ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given there iniquity;</hi> Iſa. 33.20, 24.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, O ye Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and declare it in the Iſles afare of, and ſay, he that ſcattered Iſrael, will gather him, and keep him as a ſheepheard doth his ſtock; For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and ranſomed him
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170393:94"/>from the hand of him that was ſtronger then he: Therefore they ſhall come and ſing in the hight of Zion, and ſhall flow together to the goodneſs of the Lord; for Wheat, and for Wine, and for Oyle, and for the young of the flock, and of the heard; and their ſouls ſhall be as a watered Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all,</hi> Jer. 31.10, 11, 12. Yea, in that day ſhall that ſong be ſung by the houſe of Iſrael that is in the 12. of <hi>Iſai; Yea they ſhall cry out and ſhout for joy, for great is the holy one of Iſrael, in the midſt of them,</hi> verſe the 6. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.15. <hi>They ſhall not ſee evil any more;</hi> then that in the 35. of <hi>Iſai.</hi> ſhall be made good, and that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60. and many other places which ſpeak very clearly to theſe things; ſearch and ſee, for <hi>Paul</hi> would not have us <hi>Ignorant</hi> of this <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> Rom. 11.25.</p>
               <p>Moreover be not miſtaken though it be ſo, that the fulneſs of the Gentiles under this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhall come in before Chriſt come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and many ſhall be given up to blindneſs, and be deſtroyed at his appearing, (as it hath been ſhewed before) yet them that are left of the Nations, ſhall fall in with the people of Iſrael, and ſay; <hi>Come let us go up to the mountains of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his wayes; and we will walk in his pathes; For out of Sion ſhall go forth the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170393:94"/>law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem, Iſai.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Micah.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. Yea, <hi>many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſtrong Nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord of hoſts in Jeruſalem, and to pray before the Lord; Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, in thoſe dayes it ſhall come to paſs, that ten men ſhall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you,</hi> Zach. 8.22, 23. yea <hi>Zach.</hi> ſaith, that when the <hi>Lord cometh and all the Saints with him, even then the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall be King over. all the earth, in that day ſhall there be one Lord, and his name one; and then it ſhall come to paſs that every one that is left of all the Nations which came againſt Jeruſalem, ſhall even go up from year to year, to worſhip the King the Lord of hoſts, and to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> Chap. 14.9, 14. and this as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand was ſignified under the Law, when the males came up to Jeruſalem to keep there feaſt, ſo the Nations ſhall come up from one new Moon to another, and from year to year, to worſhip before the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.23. for then the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be <hi>Converted</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Iſai.</hi> 60.5. For the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that are brought back and are called when Chriſt come, ſhall then be chief among the Nations, according to this Scripture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.24, 25. <hi>In that day ſhall Iſrael be the third,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170393:95"/>with Egypt, and with Aſſyria, even a bleſſing in the midſt of the land; whom the Lord of Hoſt ſhall bleſs ſaying, bleſſed be Egypt my people, and Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria the work of my hands, &amp; Iſrael mine Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> ſo in that day, <hi>the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea, Iſa.</hi> 11.9.</p>
               <p>So in that day when Chriſt raigns gloriouſly on the earth, there will be firſt all them that dyed in the faith, &amp; are found in the faith at his coming, made immortal, and ſhall raign with Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. injoying perfection in knowledge and purity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. and be made free from all manner of imperfections, yea as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the <hi>Fatneſs</hi> of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the <hi>River</hi> of thy pleaſures, Pſal.</hi> 36.8. So they ſhall be compleatly happy injoying fulneſs of joy, for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that is called when Chriſt appeareth (as hath been ſhewed) ſhall be under them, and governed and judged by them, <hi>Obad.</hi> 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The nations that know the Lord ſhall be inferiour to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſerving them in that day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.12, 14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That there will be ſome of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170393:95"/>in that day, that will not come to worſhip the King, the Lord of hoſts, and upon them ſhall come great judgments, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.17, 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. So there will be in the kingdome of Chriſt (at leaſt ſome of the time that he raigns on the earth, before he delivers up the Kingdome to the father) four ſorts of people, but the Saints that come with Chriſt, ſhall raign moſt gloriouſly over them all.</p>
               <p>So then, things being ſo, lets look back to what hath been ſaid concerning Chriſt coming to raign; namely, that the Saints muſt be in a troubled, perſecuted, afflicted eſtate, until Chriſt comes, and the neerer his coming, the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and tribulations, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7, 8. This ſerves to inform the fifth Monarchy men, that the Saints ſhall not have dominion of the earth, neither ſhall the fifth Monarchy be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Chriſt comes, for the fourth Monarchy, or Beaſt in his Heads and horns, raigns until Chriſt comes, and preſecutes the Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25, 26. as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there will be warr and rumors of warrs, and overturning of powers until Chriſt comes; that ſhould teach the Saints, not to deceive themſelves ſo as to conclude, they ſhall enjoy long reſt and peace here on earth, before Chriſt comes, and ſo to ſeek great things for themſelves; I ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Jer. Seek
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170393:96"/>them not, for that the Lord hath built, he will break down, and that which he hath planted, will he pluck up, Chap.</hi> 45.4, 5. <hi>For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt drink Jeremies cup, them that are wicked to the ſword, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Chap. 25. from the 15. to the 34.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſhould teach us to buy the truth and not to ſell it, and ſo to <hi>ſeek the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs,</hi> in the firſt place, and to <hi>give all diligence to make our calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure; redeeming the time,</hi> that we be not found among thoſe fooliſh Virgins that let their <hi>lamps go out;</hi> but of thoſe wiſe, that ſtand with their <hi>Loyns girded about with truth, and their lights burning,</hi> as men that wait for their Lord when he ſhall return to the wedding; <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>Furthermore take notice of ſome ſignes that go before Chriſts coming; Firſt, obſerve that the Goſpel being preached as it is now, (and ſhall be more fully hereafter) and many falling away from the truth, and the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt appearing, this is a ſign of Chriſts coming, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we ſee and hear of warrs and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of warrs, and falſe Prophets, and falſe Chriſts appearing, and many run to and fro, and knowledge increaſe, and the great Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> fallen, theſe things coming to paſs
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170393:96"/>are evident ſigns that the time of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is neer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.5, 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When we ſhall ſee falſe Prophets, and falſe Chriſts, ſaying; <hi>loe hear is Chriſt, or loe there;</hi> working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the Antichriſt or man of ſin ariſing or appearing; then may we certainly conclude the coming of Chriſt to be at hand; yea if we ſee the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> fallen, and the man of ſin ariſing, we may certainly conclude, that before that generation ſhall go down to duſt, the Lord will appear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.23, 24.2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.32.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When there ſhall be famins and peſtalence, and earth-quakes in divers places, and the Jewes return into their own land, and the Antichriſt (or man of ſin) plant his tabernacle in the holy mount, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.7.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When the Man of Sin and the falſe Prophet ſhall ſet up an Image, and give the mark of the beaſt, and cauſe fire to come down from heaven in the ſight of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13, 14, 15, 16. and the ſixth vial poured out, and that falſe miniſtry of the beaſt go forth, and gather the nations to the battel of the great day, according to <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.12, 13, 14. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.9, 10, 11. and the Sun and Moon darkned, and upon the earth diſtreſs of nations, with perplexity, the Sea and waves roaring in an extraordinary manner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.15: <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25, 26: When theſe changes begin to come to paſs, eſpecially the four laſt, then let us <hi>lift up our heads with joy, for our redemption draweth nigh, verſe</hi> 28. And when the laſt appeareth, know that the Kingdome of God is neer, even at the very doors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33. Now from all theſe things, let every one be perſwaded to walk up in all the commandments, and Ordinances of the Lord, improving all grace, ſo as to ſerve God acceptably with <hi>reverence and godly fear;</hi> yea let all the children of God, <hi>work out their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling;</hi> O let us give <hi>heed</hi> to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170393:97"/>
                  <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as a <hi>light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day of Chriſt dawn, and the day Star ariſe in our hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is, until Chriſt who is the bright morning Star he by his ſpirit; we giving heed to the word of the Prophet will cauſe us to underſtand the ſecrets of the Lord; yea the ſigns of his coming, as men that walk in the night know the day is neer, when they ſee the day Star ariſing; ſo the Lord will give us the morning Star, that we may know in an excellent meaſure the time of his coming, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>

               <p>But let no man be deceived, ſo as to account of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receiving of the ſpirit in the moſt excellent manner, to be the coming of Chriſt; for the <hi>Corinths</hi> came behind in no gifts, yet waited for the coming of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.7: And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſheweth, that there are but three ſorts of Chriſtians, the little ones; young men, and old men, in Chriſt; and old ought to wait and did wait for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2: 28: <hi>Chap.</hi> 3: 2. and then they and we ſhall be like him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 31: O let all theſe things be laid to heart, and let all the children of God receive council of the Lord Jeſus, ſo as to <hi>watch and pray alwayes, that we may be accounted worthy, to eſcape all theſe things, that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before him acceptably, Luke</hi> 21.36.</p>
